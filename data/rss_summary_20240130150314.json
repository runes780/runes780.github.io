        "summary": " The text discusses the concerns of foreign investors regarding China's souring relations with the West and the slump in its property market, which has led to a significant decline in Chinese stocks. Investors are looking for alternatives to China, leading to increased interest in funds that exclude Chinese stocks. Five years ago, Chinese stocks were in high demand as a means of diversification from rich-world markets, but now they make up less than 10% of the total foreign ownership in mainland China and Hong Kong. Some investors are turning to emerging markets such as India, South Korea, and Taiwan, as well as Japan for industrial stocks and real assets. However, these alternatives have their own drawbacks, including high valuations, maturity, and exposure to American interest rates. Despite the challenges, funds that exclude China are gaining popularity and are expected to continue to grow in response to investor demand.",

For centuries, the pound was divided into complex units, including farthings, which were eventually dropped in 1971 when decimalization occurred. However, since then, the value of the penny has significantly decreased due to inflation and the increasing use of digital payments. The pandemic accelerated the trend of falling cash usage, making pennies less useful in transactions. Additionally, seigniorage, the profit governments make from the difference between the face value and production cost of money, is no longer a significant factor since the Royal Mint has been losing money on coin-making for several years. The number of pennies minted has decreased significantly, and it's likely that the penny will eventually be phased out, possibly accompanied by the two-pence coin.",

        "summary": " Private equity has grown significantly in the past decade, managing $12 trillion in assets globally and surpassing the value of major banks. Traditional private equity, which involves buying companies with debt, improving them, and selling or listing them, has been lackluster due to high interest rates. However, private equity firms are expanding into new areas like infrastructure, property, and direct loans to companies under the label of \"private assets.\"\n\nRecently, private equity firms have been acquiring life insurers for their vast balance sheets, which provide a new source of funding. Apollo, Blackstone, and KKR have all made such acquisitions or taken minority stakes in insurers. The strategy makes sense as insurance firms invest over long periods and have traditionally bought government and corporate bonds, but private equity firms can instead invest in higher-yielding private investments.\n\nHowever, this strategy also brings risks. Pension promises are important to society, and the taxpayer implicitly backs insurance to some degree. Regulators enforce minimum capital requirements, but it is difficult to judge the safety-buffers of a firm with illiquid private assets. In a crisis, policyholders may flee, leading to a potential bank run.\n\nRegulators need to ensure that safety-buffers are adequate, enforce high standards of transparency and capital, and cooperate internationally. The goal is not to crush the new business model but to make it safer. Financial innovation can bring new benefits while also creating new risks.",

While it may appear that Americans are deeply divided between Democrats and Republicans, the reality is that a large and growing number of Americans identify as independents, with record low percentages identifying as Democrats or Republicans. The parties are not responding to this trend by making themselves more appealing but instead act as vehicles for successful candidates to commandeer during primaries.\n\nThe text explains how the party establishment has lost control over nominating candidates and that activists now play a significant role in the process, often selecting extreme candidates. Winning the Republican primary does not necessarily equate to being electable in a general election as many voters who turn out for primaries are not representative of the entire population.\n\nThe text also mentions the idea of third parties and their potential to emerge during times of polarization but notes that successful third parties have historically had specific, galvanizing issues and ran candidates down the ballot. The group No Labels, which is considering a third-party bid, has yet to make significant progress towards these goals.",

The article also mentions how Westerners are less interested in living in Hong Kong due to the city's slow economic recovery and tightening grip from China. On the other hand, people from mainland China see Hong Kong as offering more freedoms and an international feel. However, integration between the two groups may take longer than in the past due to language barriers and cultural differences.

Hezekiah Johnson Otara, the priest, promised to pay the school fees of four girls as part of the celebration. Mr Otara is among numerous African priests who have switched to Russia's branch of Orthodox Christianity due to the fallout from the Ukraine war and the Russian church's plans to expand in Africa, building schools, hospitals, and cathedrals.\n\nThe Russians are targeting the Greek Orthodox Church in Africa as part of a power struggle following the recognition of the independent Orthodox Church of Ukraine by Constantinople and Alexandria, which was seen as a betrayal by Russia. Many Greek-trained clerics have defected to the Russian church, which has promised better wages and benefits.\n\nThe Russian foray into Africa may also serve political purposes, such as spreading propaganda against the West and stoking hostility towards traditional values like opposition to homosexuality. However, the Russian church's efforts appear half-hearted, with most of its churches being makeshift structures and no evidence of well-funded schools or hospitals.\n\nThe Russian church's leadership has been erratic, with former Bishop of Klin Leonid Gorbachev initially appointed to run the African outpost but later sacked for his support of Yevgeny Prigozhin and his failed mutiny last summer. The church is facing funding cuts, and some projects have been put on hold. Despite these challenges, Mr Hovorun believes the enterprise may be winding down but admits it still poses a quixotic threat.",

The army has been deployed to quell riots from gangsters, resulting in over 2,500 arrests. The United States is offering assistance as part of an operation called Caso Metástasis, led by Attorney-General Diana Salazar. This operation aims to uncover links between drug gangs and the police, judges, and politicians. However, it has resulted in increased danger for those involved due to the violent response from the gangsters.\n\nCaso Metástasis began in 2022 after the conviction of a drug financier, Leandro Norero, who was found with large sums of cash and gold bars at his house. His mobile phones revealed evidence of bribes being paid to police officers, judges, and politicians for favorable rulings and evidence tampering. This information led to several arrests, including the president of the judiciary council and a former director of the prisons agency.\n\nHowever, the operation has faced challenges, including assassinations of prosecutors investigating drug lords and leaks of information to the gangsters. There are also concerns about deep-rooted corruption within the state, with some former presidents being accused of having ties to drug cartels. The government is struggling to provide enough security for judiciary staff and has proposed increasing VAT to pay for it.\n\nMs. Salazar's team is working to process the evidence from Mr. Norero's phones and other devices seized after the riots, but they face obstacles such as leaks of information and the release of several drug bosses from jail after a former president left office. The biggest challenge may be dealing with the corrupt officials within the state rather than the criminals on the street.",

        "title": "Why diplomacy over Sudan, Africa’s enduring nightmare, is stuck | Middle East & Africa",
        "summary": " Sudan's warlord Hemedti, who stands accused of genocide, visited Rwanda's genocide memorial and was welcomed by African leaders despite ongoing conflict in Sudan between his Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and the regular army. The RSF is waging a deadly war for control of the state, forcing over 7 million people from their homes and causing extensive damage to Khartoum and parts of the countryside. Both sides have been accused of human rights violations, but the RSF faces credible allegations of genocide in Darfur.\n\nHemedti's recent diplomatic tours across Africa have included visits to Uganda, Ethiopia, Djibouti, Kenya, and South Africa, where he was greeted with red-carpet welcomes and official receptions that befit a head of state. IGAD has also invited him to attend a summit on January 18th, leading General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, who commands the regular army and is Sudan's de facto president, to withdraw from negotiations in protest.\n\nThe diplomatic recognition granted to Hemedti by African leaders may reflect practical considerations, as he has been winning the war and receiving support from the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The UAE's backing has given him an advantage on the battlefield and strengthened his position in the region. Additionally, several east African countries seek to bolster their ties with the UAE, which is flush with petrodollars and ambitious to expand its influence across the region. Hemedti is also a member of an emerging bloc led by the UAE that includes Ethiopia, Chad, and the internationally unrecognized breakaway state of Somaliland.\n\nThe ongoing conflict in Sudan has left millions displaced and threatens to plunge parts of the country into famine. Despite the diplomatic efforts, a ceasefire remains elusive, with both sides refusing to back down from their demands.",
