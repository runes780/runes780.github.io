<div></div><p><span>“M</span><small>acky Sall</small>, Dictator!” chanted protesters on February 5th in Dakar, Senegal’s capital, as they dodged police officers firing tear gas and raged at their president. By late that evening it was getting harder to disagree. Riot police in masks and helmets marched into the National Assembly and dragged out about 30 opposition <small>MP</small>s. “It’s a coup d’état against the people,” shouted one <small>MP</small> before he was pulled away. They had been occupying the speaker’s platform in protest against a planned vote, held without any debate, to delay by almost ten months the presidential election scheduled for February 25th. Moments later the vote passed. Mr Sall will now stay in office far beyond his term, which was supposed to end on April 2nd. </p>

“马基·萨尔，独裁者！”2月5日，在塞内加尔首都达喀尔，抗议者在躲避警察发射的催泪瓦斯的同时高呼口号，并对他们的总统表示愤怒。那天晚上晚些时候，越来越多的人难以再持反对意见了。戴着面具和头盔的防暴警察进入国民议会，拽出大约30名反对党议员。其中一名议员在被拖走前大喊：“这是针对人民的政变！”他们此前一直占据着发言者的讲台，抗议一项计划中的投票，即在没有辩论的情况下推迟将近十个月原定于2月25日举行的总统选举。几分钟后，投票通过了。萨尔先生现在将留在职位上，远超他本应在4月2日结束的任期期限。

Unlike many other countries in the region, it has avoided civil wars and coups, and has had a series of largely peaceful and democratic transitions of power. Never before has it delayed a presidential election. And in a region hit by a spate of coups, Mr Sall has played a leading role in the attempts by <small>ECOWAS</small>, the regional bloc, to push juntas back towards democracy. Yet his message has been undermined by a sharp decline in freedom in Senegal itself. Now its democracy is in grave danger.</p>

塞内加尔一直被视为非洲明星：西非稳定、民主和经济增长的支柱。与该地区许多其他国家不同，它避免了内战和政变，并经历了一系列主要和平民主的权力交接。它从未推迟过总统选举。在一片军事政变浪潮中，萨尔先生在区域联盟ECOWAS推动反叛军回归民主的努力中发挥了关键作用。然而，他的信息却因塞内加尔本身自由度急剧下降而受到削弱。现在，它的民主正面临严重威胁。


<div><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p>The vote followed a speech by Mr Sall on February 3rd in which he had simply called off the election and proposed a “national dialogue” to create the “conditions for a free, transparent and inclusive election”. Yet Mr Sall held such talks just months ago. </p>

投票行动发生于2月3日，萨尔(Sall)先生在演讲中直接宣布取消选举，并提议进行“全国对话”，以创造“自由、透明和包容的选举条件”。然而，萨尔先生几个月前才举行了这样的会谈。


<p>Since then repression has ramped up alarmingly. One presidential candidate was arrested while protesting the next day. Several <small>MP</small>s who had opposed the delay attempted to campaign regardless. They too were arrested. Mobile-internet access was cut for 48 hours, motorbikes (popular with protesters) were banned, and a television station was shut down altogether. </p>

自那时起，镇压行动急剧升级，令人震惊。一位总统候选人抗议第二天的活动时被捕。几位曾反对延期的国会议员试图不顾一切地开展竞选活动。他们也被捕了。手机互联网接入被切断48小时，摩托车（抗议者常用）被禁止，一家电视台彻底关闭。


<p>The constitutional crisis was triggered by accusations of alleged corruption in the Constitutional Council, the judicial body that determines whether candidates are eligible to run. Mr Sall justified postponing the election by saying time was needed to resolve the row between the council and some members of the assembly, which had already voted to open an inquiry. </p>

宪法危机是由对宪法委员会的腐败指控引发的，宪法委员会是决定候选人资格的司法机构。萨尔先生推迟选举的理由是要时间来解决宪法委员会与议会中已投票开启调查的一些成员之间的争端。


<p>In January the council barred Ousmane Sonko, the leading opposition candidate, on the basis of his conviction for defamation in a case brought by a minister. In jail on separate charges of fomenting insurrection, Mr Sonko says the cases against him are politically motivated. The council also blocked Karim Wade, the son of a former president, from running. Mr Wade’s political party, which made the allegations of corruption against the council, has pushed for the inquiry and the delay. The council denies any wrongdoing. </p>

一月份，委员会以反对党候选人奥苏曼涅·松戈（Ousmane Sonko）的诽谤罪有罪判决为由，阻止他参选。松戈因其他煽动叛乱的指控被关押，他称针对自己的案件是出于政治动机。委员会还禁止前总统之子卡里姆·瓦德（Karim Wade）竞选。瓦德的政治党派曾对委员会提出腐败指控，现在该党推动了调查和延误。委员会否认有任何不当行为。


<p>What is Mr Sall up to? He claims to be defending democracy, warning that the dispute between judges and <small>MP</small>s “could seriously harm the credibility of the election”. Yet he is unconvincing as a democratic saviour—and not just because delaying an election and marching riot police into parliament is a curious way of defending democracy. </p>

萨尔先生到底在干什么？他声称自己是在保卫民主，警告法官与国会议员之间的纠纷“可能会严重损害选举的信誉。”然而，作为民主救世主，他的说服力并不令人信服——尤其是当推迟选举和指挥暴警察进入议会成为捍卫民主的独特方式时。


<div><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p>His government was first accused of politicising the justice system in 2019, when Mr Wade and another opposition figure were disqualified from running for president because of legal troubles. Mr Sall’s administration has also previously ignored the law, seemingly to keep Mr Sonko out of the race. (Mr Sall denies any wrongdoing.) Worse, since early 2021 at least 45 people have been killed in various protests backing Mr Sonko. </p>

2019年，政府首次被指控将司法系统政治化。当时，瓦德先生和另一位反对派人士因法律问题而被取消了总统竞选资格。萨尔总统的管理团队也曾无视法律，似乎是为阻止索尼科先生参赛。

（萨尔否认有任何不当行为。）更糟糕的是，自2021年初以来，至少有45人在支持索尼科的各种抗议活动中丧生。


<p>Given all this, many fear Mr Sall, who had backed his prime minister, Amadou Ba, for president, has malign motives. One view is that he now believes Mr Ba will lose to Mr Sonko’s number two, who is running despite also being in jail—hence Mr Sall is delaying the election, perhaps to back another horse for the presidency.</p>

鉴于以上种种，许多人担心萨尔先生有恶意。一种看法是，他现在相信巴总理将输掉选举，而索尔科的第二名候选人——尽管也在狱中——仍然参选，因此萨尔先生在拖延选举，可能是在支持另一名总统候选人。


<p>Another is that he wants to cling to power for himself, either by delaying the poll again, or by going back on his word not to run for a third term. This would seem to be in breach of the constitution’s two-term limit, but Mr Sall maintains that he can run legally. The president had previously flirted with standing again before belatedly ruling it out. But he can be fickle—he postponed the election just days after pledging to stick to the original timetable.</p>

另一个原因是，他想要为自己维持权力，要么再次推迟选举，要么违背不寻求第三任期的承诺。这似乎违反了宪法两任制的规定，但萨尔总统坚称他的竞选是合法的。

总统之前曾对再次参选有所暗示，但在最后一刻否定了这个想法。但他可以反复无常——就在承诺坚持原定时间表几天后，他又推迟了选举。


<p>Since the chaos in the National Assembly there have not been any large protests, perhaps because the police are out in force and up to 1,000 opposition members and activists have been arrested. Yet the fight is not over. There is talk of a general strike, influential religious bodies have denounced Mr Sall’s move, and the opposition is hatching plans for protests it hopes the police will find harder to stop. </p>

自全国议会的混乱以来，没有出现过大规模抗议活动，可能是因为警方出动了大量力量，多达1000名反对派成员和活动人士被逮捕。

然而斗争并未结束。有传言称将举行全面罢工，有影响力的宗教团体谴责萨尔先生的做法，而反对派正在密谋他们希望警察会更难阻止的抗议活动。


<p>The American government says that the vote to delay “cannot be considered legitimate”. Several candidates are challenging it at the Constitutional Council. They ought to have a strong case, since the constitution says that the duration of the president’s mandate cannot be amended. But since the council has been accused of impropriety, a ruling in either direction is unlikely to resolve the crisis. </p>

美国政府声称，推迟投票“不能被认为正当”。几位候选人已向宪法委员会就这一问题提出质疑。他们本应有足够的理由，因为宪法规定，总统任期的长度不得更改。但由于宪法委员会一直被指责行为不端，所以无论裁决倾向于哪一方，都不太可能解决这场危机。


<p>“We are in a situation of total uncertainty,” says Alioune Tine, a human-rights activist in Senegal. “This jump into the unknown can have unexpected consequences—like the army taking power.” <span>■</span></p>

“我们正处在一个彻底的不确定性之中，”塞内加尔的人权活动家阿利乌恩·蒂恩说。“这种对未知的突然跳入可能会产生意想不到的后果——比如军队接管政权。”■
