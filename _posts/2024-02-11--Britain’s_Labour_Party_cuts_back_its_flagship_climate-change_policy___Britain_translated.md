<div></div><p><span>A</span><small>fter months</small> of prevarication, the Labour Party has made a dramatic reversal of its plans to decarbonise <a href="https://www.economist.com/britain/2024/02/08/britains-economy-will-need-rate-cuts-sooner-rather-than-later">Britain’s economy</a>. In 2021 the party announced that if it got into power, it would spend £28bn ($35bn; 1.2% of <small>GDP</small>) annually until 2030 to cut emissions and build up green industries; it subsequently adopted the more limited goal of getting to that level of spending after 2027.</p>

在数月的拖延之后，工党戏剧性地改变了其计划，即使英国经济脱碳。2021年，该政党宣布，如果它上台执政，将在2030年前每年花费280亿英镑（350亿美元；GDP的1.2%）来削减排放并发展绿色产业；随后，它采纳了更有限的目标，在2027年后达到那样的支出水平。


<p>On February 8th <a href="https://www.economist.com/britain/2024/01/11/keir-starmer-reform-uk-and-britains-populist-paradox">Sir Keir Starmer</a>, the Labour leader, cut that figure to around £4.7bn per year, blaming the Conservative government for a weak economy, elevated borrowing costs and limited fiscal headroom. “We’ve got to adjust to the situation we find ourselves in,” said Sir Keir. “As circumstances change, you have to adjust your decisions.” The political calculation behind this decision is understandable; the policy that results remains a mess. </p>

2月8日，工党领袖基尔·施塔默爵士（Sir Keir Starmer）将这一数字削减到每年约470亿英镑，他指责保守党政府导致经济疲软、借贷成本上升和财政空间有限。“我们必须适应我们所处的情况。”基尔爵士说。“随着情况的变化，你必须调整你的决定。”

作出这一决定背后的政治考量是可以理解的；随之而来的政策仍是一团糟。

Labour’s poll lead over the Tories is titanic—21 points, according to <i>The Economist</i>’s <a href="https://www.economist.com/interactive/uk-general-election/polls">poll tracker</a>. Yet the party’s reputation for economic management still remains an area of relative weakness: only 29% of voters say Labour would be better on the economy than the Tories compared with 28% who disagree, according to a poll by Ipsos in December.</p>

从政治开始说起。根据《经济学人》的民调追踪，工党对保守党的民意领先优势极为巨大——高达21个百分点。然而，该党在经济管理方面的声誉仍然相对薄弱：根据Ipsos去年12月进行的一项民调，只有29%的选民认为工党政府在经济发展上将胜过保守党，而持相反看法的人占28%，相差无几。

全面翻译：


<p>The Conservative Party was intent on attacking the £28bn, which was an unfunded spending commitment. A political broadcast by Rishi Sunak, released on February 7th, warned that the policy would result in more borrowing or higher taxes. “Both of those things are going to cost you and your family,” he said, reviving a message that had proven potent in the Tories’ 2015 election campaign. Ditching the commitment means that the risk of Labour’s election campaign being torpedoed on grounds of fiscal irresponsibility has fallen. The change “should be enough to make Labour’s spending plans consistent with their promise to have debt on track to fall as a share of national income,” said Ben Zaranko of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, a think-tank. </p>

保守党坚决要攻击一个未经资助的280亿英镑支出承诺。2月7日发布的里希·苏纳克的政治广播警告说，这项政策将导致更多的借贷或更高的税收。“这两件事都会让你和你的家人付出代价，”他说，再次提出了在保守党2015年选举活动中证明具有强大威力的信息。放弃这一承诺意味着工党的竞选活动面临财政不负责任而导致失败的风险已经下降。“这应该足以使工党的支出计划与其承诺债务占GDP的比例有望下降一致，”智库财政研究所的本·扎兰科说。


<p>But by closing down one avenue of attack, Labour has exposed two more. The first is that Sir Keir is an unprincipled flip-flopper. The <small>U</small>-turn has been excruciatingly slow in coming. When Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, unveiled the £28bn number, the yield on ten-year British government bonds was about 1%. As yields rose, the policy was gradually hedged with so many caveats that it became a zombie, privately declared dead by some party figures but officially still in force (and described as “desperately needed” by Sir Keir as recently as February 6th). This dithering reinforces a growing critique of Sir Keir: that his deliberative, consultative approach to decision-making is simply too slow for modern government. </p>

但是，工党通过关闭一种攻击方式，无意间暴露出另外两种问题。首先，人们对基尔爵士的质疑加剧——他是没有原则、反复无常的人。这一政策的大逆转来得极其缓慢。当财政大臣影子部长雷切尔·里夫斯公布280亿英镑这个数字时，英国10年期国债收益率大约为1%。随着收益率上升，这项政策逐渐被诸多附带条件所缓和，以至于它变成了一个“僵尸”，一些党内人士私下宣布其死亡，但官方仍称其有效（基尔爵士甚至在2月6日的最新声明中形容该政策“至关重要”）。这种摇摆不决进一步加剧了对基尔爵士日益增长的批评——他的深思熟虑、咨询式的决策方式对于现代政府来说过于缓慢。


<div><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p>The second avenue of attack is that Labour does not have a vision for government. Junking the policy was met with despair by many in Labour’s ranks who want faster action on climate change and question whether the decision leaves much of an agenda at all. It makes the party more vulnerable to poaching from its left flank, particularly by the Green Party and the Scottish National Party. </p>

第二种攻击方式是，工党没有为政府提供一个愿景。许多工党内人士对于应对气候变化行动感到绝望，并质疑这一决定是否还留下了任何实质性的议程。这使得该政党更加容易受到来自左翼的渗透，特别是绿党和苏格兰民族党。


<p>As for the policy, the end of the £28bn-a-year target is not something to mourn. The pledge was retrospectively cast as a response to the American government’s Inflation Reduction Act, a vast package of green-energy tax breaks, and similar responses in Europe. Yet Labour never properly acknowledged the challenge that Britain faces, as a mid-sized economy with weak public finances, in rivalling America in luring investment. </p>

至于政策，每年280亿英镑目标的终结并不是什么值得哀悼的事。当时的承诺后来被追溯性地解释为对美国政府《通胀减少法案》的回应——该法案包含大规模的绿色能源税收减免措施，以及欧洲类似的举措。然而，工党从未真正承认英国所面临的挑战：作为一个中等规模经济体，公共财政薄弱，要在吸引投资方面与美国竞争。


<p>Its size may also have been beyond what was needed. The Climate Change Committee (<small>CCC</small>), which advises the government on the climate transition, estimates that reaching net zero requires total public and private investment in green projects to increase from around £10bn per year in 2020 to about £50bn per year by the end of this decade, and to stay at that level until 2050. But only £9bn-12bn of that amount (in 2020 prices) would need to be public money, significantly less than Labour’s original scheme. </p>

其规模可能也超过了实际所需。为政府提供关于气候转型建议的气候变化委员会（CCC）估计，实现净零排放需要到2020年为止，公共和私人在绿色项目上的总投资从每年约1,000亿英镑增加到本十年末的大约5,000亿英镑，并且要保持在这个水平直到2050年。但其中只有900亿至1,200亿英镑（按照2020年的价格）需要是公共资金，远少于工党的原始计划。


<p>The heft of the programme skewed Labour’s plans. Out of a possible £224bn of spending envisaged under the original scheme, only £68bn had actually been earmarked for projects. But the commitment had the effect of crowding out other spending. The party has announced almost no new additional capital expenditure elsewhere. Members of the shadow cabinet hoped they could recast things like repairs to ageing schools as decarbonisation measures in order to qualify for green funds. </p>

庞大的项目规模使工党的计划偏向一边。在最初设想的可能高达2,240亿英镑的支出中，实际上只有680亿英镑被专门划拨给了项目。但这一承诺的效果是挤占了其他开支的空间。该党几乎在其他任何新的额外资本支出上都没有宣布。影子内阁成员希望他们可以把修复老化学校的维修工作重新定义为减排措施，以便有资格获得绿色资金。




<p>If ditching the £28bn number makes sense, however, today’s announcement still raises difficult questions for Labour. The party says that it will go ahead with plans to create a state-owned energy company and to insulate homes, albeit at a reduced pace, and that its goal of decarbonising Britain’s electricity supply by 2030, with private investment doing the heavy lifting, remains intact. That ambition already seems deeply improbable given delays to the Hinkley Point <small>C</small> nuclear-power station; and spending less than the <small>CCC </small>recommends each year would make it harder to reach longer-term goals. </p>

然而，如果放弃280亿英镑的数字确实有意义，那么今天的公告仍然给工党带来了难题。该党表示，它将继续推进国有能源公司和房屋绝缘化的计划，尽管速度会有所减慢；到2030年实现英国电力供应脱碳的目标，私有投资承担主要任务，这一目标仍然保持不变。这个雄心壮志在考虑到欣克利角C核电站的延误以及每年花费低于经合组织建议的数量时，似乎变得极其不可能。减少长期目标的可行性。


<p>The curtailed programme also does nothing to resolve the fundamental tension in Labour’s climate policy: whether its “Green Prosperity Plan” is primarily about greening the economy or making it more prosperous. The party still promises a “national wealth fund”, with £7.3bn in capitalisation to invest in schemes such as hydrogen manufacturing and ports, as well as a “British jobs bonus” that would offer up to £500m a year in capital grants to firms that set up in poor regions. Ed Miliband, the shadow environment secretary, often complains that although Britain has rapidly expanded offshore wind generation, many of the turbines are operated by foreign state-owned firms such as Denmark’s Ørsted. </p>

削减后的计划同样未能解决工党气候政策的根本紧张关系：其“绿色繁荣计划”是主要着眼于绿化经济，还是使其更加繁荣？该党依然承诺设立一个“国家财富基金”，初始资本化为73亿英镑，用于投资氢制造、港口等此类项目，以及提供一个所谓的“英国工作岗位奖金”，每年最多可提供50亿英镑的资本拨款给那些在贫困地区建立的企业。

反对党环境事务发言人埃德·米尔班德经常抱怨说，尽管英国迅速扩大了海上风力发电，但许多涡轮机都是由丹麦奥拉斯特等外国国有企业的运营。


<p>Yet money spent to subsidise the manufacturing of wind turbines and the like in Britain over cheaper foreign imports raises the cost of net zero overall. And that is money which cannot be spent on more efficient drivers of the transition, such as consumer subsidies to encourage people to buy electric cars and heat pumps. Sir Keir’s climate <small>U</small>-turn has been a long time in coming but a bigger rethink is still needed. ■ </p>

然而，在英国补贴风力发电机等制造业，而不是购买更便宜的外国进口，增加了实现净零总成本。而这部分钱本可以用于支持过渡期中更具效率的推动因素，比如对消费者提供补贴以鼓励他们购买电动汽车和热泵。Keir爵士在气候问题上的大转变来之不易，但还需要更大的反思。■
