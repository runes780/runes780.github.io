<div></div><p><span>“W</span><small>hether you’ve</small> got money or not, do go home for lunar new year.” So goes a sentimental Chinese pop song. This year’s Spring Festival, as the occasion is also known, begins on February 10th. In recent weeks millions of China’s migrant workers, who spend most of the year toiling in cities, have been travelling back to their villages to celebrate with their families. Some are returning with hard-earned cash, which they might stuff into red envelopes (per tradition) and give to their children. Others, though, are coming home empty-handed—not because they are lazy, but because they have not been paid. </p>

歌词如是说：“无论你有钱没钱，新年回家过节总是必要的。”中国的农历春节，又称春节或过年，将于2月10日拉开序幕。近几周内，数百万在中国城市辛勤劳动的农民工已纷纷踏上归乡的旅程，与家人团聚共庆新春佳节。有些务工者带着辛苦挣来的钞票回家，按照传统习俗，他们可能将这些钱装入红色信封，并赠予自己的孩子。然而也有些返家的人两手空空——并不是因为他们懒惰，而是因为他们没有得到应有的薪资报酬。

Migrant workers are rarely given formal employment contracts. China’s state-run labour unions (independent ones are banned) often side with management in disputes. So companies are under little pressure to pay workers in a timely manner. Sometimes, when business is bad, they refuse to pay them at all. Tensions typically come to a head in the period before the Spring Festival, when migrant workers scramble to get months of back pay before going home.</p>

中国的工资拖欠问题长期存在。农民工很少被给予正式的劳动合同。中国官方的劳工工会（独立工会被禁止）在纠纷中常常站在管理一方。因此，企业几乎没有压力按时支付工人。有时，在生意不景气时，他们甚至拒绝支付任何报酬。紧张局势通常会在春节前达到顶峰，那时农民工争先恐后地争取数月拖欠工资，然后回家。

Protests over unpaid wages in the period before the Spring Festival have doubled compared with last year, according to data from China Labour Bulletin, a watchdog organisation in Hong Kong (see chart). Several local governments have voiced concerns. The “severity and complexity of the situation cannot be ignored”, said the Communist Party boss of Huaibei, a city in the eastern province of Anhui, last month. </p><p>Many of those demanding back pay are construction workers, of which China has about 52m. Four years ago the government introduced policies designed to cool an overheating property market. But the measures proved too effective, sending the industry into crisis. Meanwhile, the uncertainty of the pandemic caused potential buyers to save their money instead. As a result of all this, many developers halted big projects—and many workers on those projects have not been paid. </p><p>One of them is Zhang Yongyin, who is from Guizhou, a poor province in the south-west of China. Last summer he worked on a project by Evergrande, a property behemoth that has been crippled by debt. Mr Zhang says he is still owed 30,000 yuan ($4,220) by one of the subcontractors. He needs the money to pay his mortgage and buy his child new clothes. “Everyone doing construction work has lost heart,” he says.</p><p>Unpaid workers often band together to put pressure on companies. Some block roads. Others are more creative. In January a group of workers at a factory in Zhejiang province threatened to jump off a government building unless they were paid. Such stunts are usually posted online to drum up support. (The group did not jump.)</p></div><div><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p>The central government says it wants to help. In December officials launched a campaign to “eradicate” the problem of unpaid wages, threatening to punish recalcitrant firms. But previous efforts have had little effect. Although the government can force state-owned companies to cough up, it has little sway over the private contractors that are at the heart of the problem, says Aidan Chau of China Labour Bulletin. </p>

中央政府表示愿意提供帮助。去年12月，官员们发起了一场运动，要“根除”欠薪问题，并威胁要惩罚顽固的企业。但之前的努力收效甚微。中国劳动研究会的艾丹·肖说，虽然政府可以迫使国有企业支付，但它对问题的核心——私营承建商——几乎没有影响力。


<p>In any case, the government is more concerned about social stability. That means it often targets workers, too. Officials fume about “illegal gatherings” aimed at shaming companies. A county in the western province of Gansu has threatened to punish workers for the dangerous act of displaying banners during protests.</p>

无论如何，政府更关心社会稳定。这意味着它常常也将工人作为目标。官员们对于旨在羞辱公司的“非法集会”愤慨不已。甘肃省西部的一个县甚至威胁要惩罚抗议活动中展示横幅的工人，这被视为危险的行为。


<p>At an informal labour market in southern Beijing, two dozen workers recently waited in the cold, hoping to earn a little extra money before heading home for the holiday. Few jobs are on offer, though. It has been a tough year, they say. The workers at least take some comfort in their shared hardship. Going home with no money would usually be humiliating. But this year, says Mr Zhang, many of his neighbours have no money either. <span>■</span></p>

在北京南部一个非正式的劳动力市场，最近有二十余名工人冒着寒冷等待，希望在节前挣点额外的钱回家。然而提供的工作机会很少。他们说这是一年中最艰难的时候。至少工人们可以从共享的困难中找到一些安慰。通常情况下，带着没钱回家的情况会令人感到羞辱。但张先生说，今年他很多邻居也同样身无分文。■
