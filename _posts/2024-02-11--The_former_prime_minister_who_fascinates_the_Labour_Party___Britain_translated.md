<div></div><p><span>S</span><small>IR KEIR STARMER</small> sometimes says that he must emulate all three previous leaders of the Labour Party to win governing majorities. He has to revive a battered country like Clement Attlee (who was prime minister in 1945-51), modernise the economy like Harold Wilson (1964-70, 1974-76) and fix public services like Sir Tony Blair (1997-2007). The second of this trio particularly fascinates the party. Sir Keir flecks his speeches with Wilson-era clichés (“white heat” and “the pound in your pocket”). Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, is an admirer, as is Nick Thomas-Symonds, a shadow minister and author of a well-reviewed Wilson biography.</p>

工党前两位领导人尤其让党内着迷。基尔爵士在他的演讲中点缀着哈罗德·威尔逊时代的陈词滥调（“炽热的白色”和“你口袋里的英镑”）。影子财政大臣雷切尔·里夫斯是他的仰慕者之一，还有尼克·托马斯-西蒙兹，他是一名影子部长，也撰写了一本评价很高的哈罗德·威尔逊传记。

Labour’s left reviled him as a schemer, the party’s right as a relic who had failed to modernise Britain’s economy or tame the unions. He has undergone a resurrection in part due to Labour’s chronic nostalgia, and in part because it is tired of losing and Wilson was a winner (“the sine qua non of a successful leader,” notes Mr Thomas-Symonds). The dates of his election victories are used by some in the party as shorthand for possible outcomes this year: a “’64” (a tiny majority), a “’66” (a big majority) or a “’74” (a hung parliament followed by a majority in another election called soon after). But the Wilson renaissance is also because his era has strong parallels with Labour’s position today. </p>

威尔逊离任时，其形象因丑闻和对MI5对他阴谋的痴迷而受损。工党的左翼将他痛恨为一个策划者，而右翼则视他为一个过时的遗迹，未能使英国经济现代化或驯服工会。他的复兴部分源于工党长期的怀旧情绪，同时也因为人们厌倦了失败，而威尔逊是个赢家（托马斯-西蒙兹先生指出，“成功领导者必不可少”的条件）。他在选举中的胜利日期被党内的一些人用作今年可能结果的简称：“64”（微弱多数），“66”（大多数）或“74”（议会产生悬空，随后在不久后举行的另一次选举中获得多数）。然而，威尔逊的复兴还因为他的时代与工党当前的处境有强烈的相似之处。


<div><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p>Sir Keir, born two years before Wilson entered Downing Street, has followed a similar course. Both are workaholics from lower-middle-class families: Wilson’s father was an industrial chemist, Sir Keir’s a toolmaker. Wilson aligned himself with the leftist Aneurin Bevan, before becoming the Labour leader by tacking to the centre. Sir Keir, with a similar methodical ambition, served under Jeremy Corbyn before moving rightwards. Both marry high-mindedness with low cunning. “This party is a moral crusade or it is nothing,” said Wilson of Labour. “He never much believed in ideology; he was an operator,” said Roy Jenkins, his home secretary. Both shed a stiff, academic bearing for an everyman routine; a pipe, a mackintosh and a bottle of <small>HP</small> sauce were Wilson’s props.</p>

基尔爵士出生于伍尔森进入唐宁街两年之前，他走的是类似的道路。他们都是工作狂，来自中下层阶级家庭：伍尔森的父亲是一名工业化学家，基尔爵士则是一名工具制造商。伍尔森与左翼的阿诺林·贝文站在一起，然后通过向中心靠拢成为工党的领导人。基尔爵士以类似的方法和雄心壮志，在杰里米·科尔宾手下效力，然后向右移动。他们都将高瞻远瞩与狡猾手段相结合。“这个政党要么是一场道德进军，否则什么都不是，”伍尔森这样形容工党。“他从来都不怎么相信意识形态；他是一个操作者，”他的内政大臣罗伊·詹金斯说。他们都摆脱了僵硬的学术风范，转而采用平民化的日常程序：烟斗、麦克斯沃特风雨大衣以及一瓶 HP 酱汁是伍尔森的道具。


<p>Sir Keir will campaign like Wilson. In 1964, as today, Labour attacked “13 wasted years” of economic mismanagement and stagnation (in fact, real income growth has been far worse this time round). Sixties Britain was suffused with a declinist anxiety, which Sir Keir has revived. Britain is slipping so far behind its peers, he says, that the young will soon look for work in Poland. </p>

基尔勋爵的竞选活动将效仿威尔逊。1964年，就像今天一样，工党抨击保守党“十三年的经济管理失误和停滞不前”（实际上，这一轮的真实收入增长要糟糕得多）。六十年代的英国弥漫着衰败焦虑，基尔勋爵将其重新点燃。他说，英国已经远远落后于其竞争对手，年轻人很快会去波兰找工作。


<p>Sir Keir has also revived the rhetoric of class and meritocracy that Wilson turned into a cudgel. The root of Britain’s economic woes, said Wilson, was that the cabinet and boardrooms were stuffed with aristocratic duffers whose “grouse-moor conception of national leadership” was unfit for the jet age; Britain needed scientifically minded go-getters. (Sir Keir, who talks of a “class ceiling”, switches grouse moor for Rishi Sunak’s helicopter.) The answer was the expansion of comprehensive schooling and universities, which some in the shadow cabinet regard as Labour’s greatest achievement. The foe of the “old school tie” would doubtless have cheered Ms Reeves’s plan to levy <small>VAT</small> on private schools.</p>

威尔森将阶级和精英主义的修辞变成了棍棒。然而，对于英国经济困境的根本原因，威尔森认为内阁和董事会中充斥着贵族无能者，他们的“狩猎场领导国家的概念”不适合喷气时代；英国需要有科学头脑的进取者。(在谈论“阶级天花板”的同时，基尔爵士将“狩猎场”替换为里希·苏纳克乘坐的直升机。)答案是普及综合学校和大学教育，这被影子内阁中的一些人视为工党最伟大的成就之一。反对“旧学校领带”阶层的敌人无疑会欢呼里斯·雷夫斯计划对私立学校征收增值税。


<div><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p>The shadow chancellor’s economic agenda has a Wilsonesque edge. His “national plan”, announced in 1965, promised to lift growth to 3.8% a year in order to stave off a currency crisis, fix regional imbalances and fund the swelling welfare state. Her growth “mission” targets the highest per-person increase in <small>GDP</small> in the <small>G</small>7. They share a vision of an active Whitehall working hand-in-glove with businesses and the unions to steer investment to productive ends. Like Wilson, the party’s leadership today admires glossy manufacturing over services, wants a spree of housebuilding and preaches dull reform over <i>grands projets</i>. </p>

影子财政大臣的经济议程带有威尔逊式的锋芒。他于1965年宣布的“国家计划”承诺将经济增长率提升至每年3.8%，以避免货币危机、解决区域不平衡问题，并为日益庞大的福利国家提供资金。

她提出的“增长使命”目标是在G7国家中实现人均国内生产总值（GDP）最高增长率。

他们共享着一个政府积极干预，与企业和工会紧密合作，引导投资走向生产性目的的愿景。如同威尔逊一样，当今政党的领导层欣赏制造业的光泽而非服务业，并倡导大规模建房活动，同时提倡沉闷的改革而非宏大项目。


<p>David Edgerton, a historian, argues that Sir Keir’s ambition to remake capitalism pales compared with Wilson’s. But there are still important things for Labour to learn from his premierships. Wilson’s national plan was immediately undermined by pressure on sterling and the deflationary policies needed to support it. Wilson resisted devaluing the pound until 1967, harming his authority in the process. That left him too weak to pass trade-union reforms. At the time of writing, Sir Keir was expected to scrap a plan to spend £28bn ($35bn) per year on green energy after months of dithering over its affordability given the state of the public finances. If so, he has belatedly learned one lesson from Wilson: Labour must act faster to acknowledge hard realities. </p>

历史学家大卫·埃杰顿（David Edgerton）提出，Sir Keir重塑资本主义的雄心与威尔逊时期的诸多事件相比显得微不足道。然而，对于工党来说，从威尔逊担任首相时期汲取的重要教训仍有待学习。

在撰写本文时，人们预期Sir Keir会放弃一项计划——每年花费280亿英镑（350亿美元）发展绿色能源。这一举措源于他对当前公共财政状况下绿色能源成本的犹豫不决。

如果这种情况真的发生，那么Sir Keir最终还是学到了威尔逊的一个教训：工党必须更快地承认严峻现实，行动要更加果决。


<p>A second lesson concerns the Treasury. Wilson tried to bypass its short-term instincts (“very, very skilled chaps in more or less stopping you doing anything”) by setting up a rival Department for Economic Affairs to run industrial planning. It was short-lived. The party today doesn’t plan to break up the Treasury; Ms Reeves is shaping up to be an imperial chancellor. But it needs to figure out how to strengthen the centre of government so that its “missions” of long-term reform aren’t strangled by bean-counting. </p>

第二课涉及财政部。伍德罗·威尔逊试图绕过其短期本能（“非常、非常熟练的家伙，他们基本上能阻止你做任何事”） ，通过建立一个与之竞争的经济事务部来管理工业规划。但这未能持久。如今的政党不打算拆分财政部；里维斯女士正逐步成为一个帝国财政大臣。但它需要弄清楚如何强化政府中心，以确保其“使命”——长期改革——不会被会计核算窒息。


<h2>He who rejects change is the architect of decay</h2>

拒绝变革者，实乃衰败之设计师。


<p>The third lesson is that centre-left leaders can create the space for radical social reforms if they themselves hew to bread-and-butter concerns. Wilson oversaw a dizzying legal revolution: the abolition of capital punishment, the legalisation of homosexuality and abortion, the end of theatre censorship, and the passage of race- and sex-equality laws. Yet Wilson left the heavy lifting on such issues to Jenkins and others. He told his speechwriters to stick to working-class concerns: “I don’t want too many of those Guardian-isms, Environmentalism, Genderism etc.” </p>

第三课是，如果中左翼领导人自己也能坚守面包和黄油的议题，那么他们就能够为激进的社会改革创造空间。威尔逊监督了一场令人眼花缭乱的法律革命：废除死刑、使同性恋和堕胎合法化、终止戏剧审查制度，并通过种族和性别平等法。然而，威尔逊还是让詹金斯和其他人来处理这些问题的主要部分。他告诉他的演讲稿撰写者专注于工人阶级的关注：“我不希望太多那种《卫报》式的玩意儿——环保主义、性别主义等等。”


<p>Sir Keir’s speeches are blue-collar, yet he also shows glimmers of radicalism: he has indicated that he would welcome the decriminalisation of euthanasia should a private members’ bill be brought. Ben Pimlott’s biography of Wilson, published in 1992, affords his social reforms only passing mention over 700 pages. A leader can achieve a lot if they don’t care who gets the credit. <span>■</span></p>

 Keir爵士的演讲风格质朴，但他也展现出激进思想的闪烁：他曾表示，如果由私人成员提出法案，他将欢迎安乐死的除罪化。1992年出版的Ben Pimlott编写的温斯顿·丘吉尔传记，在长达700页的内容中，只简略地提到了他的社会改革。一个领导者如果不在乎谁获得赞誉，他们就能取得很大成就。■
