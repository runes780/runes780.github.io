# Australia’s enthusiasm for immigration is being tested | Asia

Immigrants have increased its population by more than a third this century, to over 26m. The promise of sunshine and well-paid work first drew European migrants; now more come from China and India. This has never triggered a major populist backlash: most Australians have welcomed the newcomers with open arms. But now their tolerance is being tested.</p><div><figure><div><figcaption>Listen to this story.</figcaption> <span>Enjoy more audio and podcasts on<!-- --> <a href="https://www.economist.comhttps://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/bed1b25" id="audio-ios-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">iOS</a> <!-- -->or<!-- --> <a href="https://www.economist.comhttps://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/7f3c199" id="audio-android-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Android</a>.</span></div><audio controls="" id="audio-player" preload="none" src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/029%20Asia%20-%20Australia%20and%20immigration-e8e87a48e69bca987aaf7c24e2fb5e4f.mp3" title="Australia’s enthusiasm for immigration is being tested"><p>Your browser does not support the &lt;audio&gt; element.</p></audio><div><div></div></div></figure></div><p>The cause is a massive recent influx. Net migration, a measure of immigrants minus emigrants, passed 500,000 in the year to July 2023. That was double the pre-pandemic level—and added more than the population of Canberra, Australia’s capital, to the national total. The huge increase has coincided with a housing crisis, which is being widely blamed on immigrants. The “social licence” for migration is fraying, admits the centre-left Labor government of Anthony Albanese. In December it pledged to halve the annual immigration rate over the next two years.</p><p>The social licence rests on a trade-off. For two decades both major parties have pushed border security as a means to stop asylum-seekers, or “boat people”, while letting in ever-more skilled workers and students. Net migration more than doubled between 2000 and 2019, fuelling some of the fastest rates of population growth in the<small> OECD</small>, a club mainly of rich countries<small>.</small> That fuelled a growth spurt—until a long covid-19 lockdown triggered a recession and left Australia short of workers.</p><div><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p>After it threw open its borders in November 2021, the influx resumed. And Australians have started to grumble. They are not throwing up fences, exactly. In a survey last year 78% said immigration made their country stronger. But most of them would prefer less of it: two polls in December found that around 60% think the current intake is too high. The percentage of Australians who rank immigration as their biggest worry more than doubled, to 13%, between September and December, according to Freshwater Strategy, a pollster.</p><p>The cost of housing is a big reason. Property prices have soared despite high borrowing costs, and Australia faces a chronic shortage of rentals. A lack of building is the main cause, but both major parties concede that high immigration is exacerbating the problem. “We’ve got a generation of Australians who can’t even get into a rental…it is not the time to be running very large migration programmes,” said the home-affairs minister, Clare O’Neil.</p><p>Mr Albanese pledges to cut immigration to a “sustainable level”. His government plans to reduce net migration to a roughly pre-pandemic level of 235,000 by 2027. According to Abul Rizvi, a former deputy secretary of Australia’s Department of Immigration, this is the first time an Australian government has set such a target in spite of the obvious risk to growth. </p><p>The cuts may be less drastic than they sound. Immigration was in line to fall anyway, as a backlog of pandemic-era applications is cleared. Still, the government promises a “crackdown”, particularly on visas for students, the biggest migrant cohort. The government says many are gaming the system by enrolling in dud courses.</p><p>Is a more populist debate brewing? That is unlikely, says Nick Biddle of the Australian National University. Australia’s skills-based migration system gives priority to people with the qualifications it needs. That lessens the usual griping about wage competition from low-skilled migrants. Politicians are also wary of alienating the third of Australians who were born outside the country. Both parties maintain that Australia is a “beautiful multicultural country”, as Ms O’Neil puts it. For now, this still sets Australia apart. <span>■</span></p>
