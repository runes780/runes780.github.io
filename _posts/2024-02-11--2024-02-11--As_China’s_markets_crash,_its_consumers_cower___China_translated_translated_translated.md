<div></div><p><span>M</span><small>OST EMERGING</small> economies struggle to live within their means; China struggles to live up to them. Even in the best of times, the combined spending of its households, firms and government is not enough to buy all that it can produce, leaving a surplus that must be exported: the country has run a trade surplus for 34 of the past 40 years. And these are not the best of times. China is enduring its longest spell of deflation since the Asian crisis over a quarter-century ago. An epic stockmarket rout since late 2022 has seen investors lose $2trn.</p>

大多数新兴经济体都在艰难地实现收支平衡；而中国则在努力满足外界的期望。即便是在最好的年景里，中国家庭、企业、政府的总支出也未能购买其全部产出，从而产生过剩必须出口：过去40年中，有34年中国的贸易是顺差。而这还不是最好的年景。中国正在经历自25年前亚洲金融危机以来最长时间的通缩期。自2022年底开始的一轮史诗级股市崩盘让投资者损失了高达20万亿美元。


<p>Behind that panic lies a deeper fear among investors and officials, namely that China no longer has a reliable driver of growth. The property boom is over. Cash-strapped developers are afraid to build flats and households are afraid to buy them. The infrastructure mania has run out of road: indebted local governments lack the funds. Exporting goods to the rest of the world, which China relied on for decades to escape poverty, is getting harder as protectionism rises and Western countries become wary of relying on authoritarian states.</p>

恐慌的背后，隐藏着投资者和官员更深的恐惧——即中国不再拥有可靠的经济增长驱动力。房地产热潮已成过去。资金紧张的开发商不敢再建公寓，而家庭也害怕购买。基础设施热已经无路可走：负债累累的地方政府缺乏资金。

几十年来，中国依靠向世界其他地区出口商品来摆脱贫困，但现在随着保护主义抬头和西方国家对依赖专制政权心存警惕，这一做法正变得越来越困难。


<div><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p>Much therefore rests on one remaining source of growth: boosting the spending of China’s 1.4bn people. “The Chinese market, with its vast space and growing depth, will play an important role in boosting aggregate global demand,” Li Qiang, China’s prime minister, told the World Economic Forum in Davos last month. A new <small>IMF</small> review of China’s prospects published on February 2nd contains 61 references to the word “consumption”.</p>

因此，很大程度上取决于经济增长的另一个潜在来源：提振中国14亿人口的消费。中国政府总理李强在上个月达沃斯的世界经济论坛上表示：“中国市场广阔且深度不断拓展，将在提振全球总需求方面发挥重要作用。”2月2日发布的一份新的国际货币基金组织（IMF）对中国前景的评估报告中包含了61次“消费”一词的提及。


<p>The goal of raising consumption makes sense. China’s stingy consumers often prefer to save, not spend. Consumption accounts for 53% of <small>GDP</small>, compared with 72% for the world. On this measure China ranks 156th out of 168 countries. Its resulting lopsided contribution to the world economy is stark. It accounts for 32% of global investment and 18% of <small>GDP</small>, but only 13% of consumption, according to Michael Pettis, an economist. Even among emerging economies, China stands out: it consumed 7% less per person than Brazil in 2022, even though it produced about 40% more.</p>

提高消费的目标合乎情理。中国的消费者常常被称作吝啬鬼，他们倾向于储蓄而非消费。根据数据，消费占GDP的53%，而全球这一比例为72%。在这一指标上，中国在全球168个国家中的排名是第156位。

由此导致的中国经济对世界经济贡献的不平衡现象十分明显。中国的全球投资份额占比达到32%，GDP份额为18%，但消费份额只有13%，经济学家Michael Pettis指出这一点。

即使是在新兴经济体中，中国也显得与众不同：在2022年，中国人均消费比巴西少7%，尽管中国的生产量大约是巴西的40%。


<p>What are the prospects of rising consumption bailing China out? The good news is that 2023 showed some recovery as the end of pandemic-era restrictions allowed people to return to restaurants, shops and travel. As a result, consumption accounted for over 80% of growth, the biggest share since 1999. The bad news is that the prospects of a step change appear slight, based on the public mood, cross-country maths and China’s own history.</p>

消费上升能否帮助中国走出困境？好消息是，2023年显示出一些复苏迹象。随着疫情时代的限制措施逐渐解除，人们能够重返餐馆、商店和旅行中。因此，消费占据了增长的80%以上，这是自1999年以来最大的份额。

然而，消费显著增加的可能性似乎不大。基于公众情绪、跨国数学以及中国自身的历史，这样的转变显得不太可能。


<p>Start with the public mood. The turmoil in the property market has damaged the income, assets and morale of ordinary Chinese. Take Mr Chen, a construction worker from Jiangsu province. He has struggled at times to find work—and is not always paid when he does. He ploughed his savings into a flat for his children in a town near his village, where many properties cannot find buyers. “What’s frightening is not the past, but the future.” The mood is mirrored in forecasts: the <small>IMF</small> expects consumption growth to slow during 2024. </p>

首先关注公众情绪。房地产市场的动荡已经损害了普通中国人的真实收入、资产和士气。以江苏省的建筑工人陈先生为例，他有时难以找到工作，而且即使有工作也不总是能按时拿到报酬。他将自己的积蓄投入到了位于他村庄附近城镇的一套公寓中，这套公寓是为他的孩子们准备的，而那里许多房产都找不到买主。“令人恐惧的不是过去，而是未来。”这种情绪在预测中得到了反映：国际货币基金组织(IMF)预计2024年期间消费增长将放缓。


<div><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><div><figure><span><img alt="" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/776/90/media-assets/image/20240210_EPC299.png"/></span></figure><p>Then consider the cross-country maths. Even if China escapes deflation this year, the long-term pivot required is daunting. For China to successfully rebalance its economy, consumption would need to rise by about ten percentage points of <small>GDP</small>, according to calculations by Mr Pettis. <i>The Economist</i> has examined how often this sort of shift has occurred around the world, looking at the experience of 181 countries since 1960 and dividing their economic history into rolling ten-year intervals. We found that only in 11% of cases did consumption rise by more than ten percentage points in the space of a decade (see chart). Some of these cases are not encouraging. Albania had a consumption mania in the early 1990s but also experienced hyperinflation. Taiwan managed a ten-point shift from 1986 to 1996, but the consumer boom was associated with a wild stockmarket bubble.</p><p>Finally, consider China’s own history. Its policymakers have talked about rebalancing the economy towards consumption, and away from exports and investment, for almost 20 years, since a key economic conference at the end of 2004. Back then, total consumption’s share of <small>GDP</small> was about 55%—about the same as today. Rebalancing, it seems, is easier said than done.</p><p><b>The right kind of consumption</b></p><p>Despite this, China has little choice but to try. One option is to promote a new consumer culture. Mr Li, in his Davos speech, spoke of the widening purchase of big-ticket items, such as electric vehicles, as well as niche products including “smart” homes, tickets to sporting events and “China-chic goods”. But social change cuts both ways. Even as they say they want to promote spending, officials are on guard against the wrong kind. Draft regulations on video games, issued in December then withdrawn, instructed companies to punctuate their games with pop-up warnings against “irrational consumption behaviour”. China’s leaders could, alternatively, stimulate consumption through short-term handouts to households. But they seem to view such handouts as ineffective, wasteful or worse: an invitation to laziness. </p></div><p>That means the most plausible lever is to make citizens feel more financially secure, so that they save less and splurge more. Expanding health care and pension provision further is key in the long run. And citizens like Mr Chen might feel relaxed about spending more if it were easier for them to settle in the cities in which they work. Under China’s <i>hukou</i> system, a household registry, Mr Chen is officially a resident of his home village. That makes it harder for him to access schools, hospitals or pensions in the cities where he earns a living. </p>

这意味着最可行的杠杆是让公民感到更经济上的安全，这样他们就能少储蓄多消费。从长远来看，进一步扩大医疗保健和养老金提供至关重要。像陈先生这样的市民可能会感觉更放松，如果他们在工作的城市更容易安顿下来的话。在中国的“户口制度”下，陈先生正式居住在他的家乡。这使得他更难获得他在谋生的城市中的学校、医院或退休金的访问权。


<p>Cai Fang of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences thinks giving migrant workers urban <i>hukou</i> could raise their consumption by as much as 30%, although other studies report less dramatic results. A study by economists at Southwestern University of Finance and Economics in Chengdu found that rural migrants who obtain urban <i>hukou</i> spend about as much as native city-dwellers, but do so more conspicuously. The end of the housing bubble could also liberate consumers. The cost of saving for a down-payment and servicing a mortgage was 11% of city-dwellers’ disposable income in 2021, according to rough estimates by Goldman Sachs. That figure could fall to about 6% in a decade, it estimates. </p>

中国社会科学院的蔡方认为，如果农民工获得城市户口（即“市民化”），他们的消费可能因此增加高达30%，尽管其他研究报告的结果没那么戏剧性。成都有西南财经大学经济学家进行的一项研究发现，农村移民在获得城市户口后，其消费大致与本地城市居民相当，但消费行为更为显眼。房地产泡沫的结束也可能解放消费者。根据高盛粗略估计，2021年，为首付和房贷储蓄的成本占城市居民可支配收入的11%。该机构预计，在未来十年里，这一比例可能下降到约6%。


<div><div><div id="econ-3"></div></div></div><p>Yet for now China’s approach to <i>hukou </i>reform is timid and piecemeal, any dividend from the housing pivot is years away, and there is little sign of comprehensive welfare-state reform. Consumption will probably increase somewhat as a share of <small>GDP</small>, as a large cohort of retiring workers keeps spending but stops producing. The associated demographic drag, however, is hardly positive for growth. For economically insecure citizens like Mr Chen, the equation points only one way. At 51 he is only nine years from the customary retirement age for blue-collar workers. But he must look after his parents as well as his youngest child. “It all depends on me. I don’t dare do the maths.” For China’s government the calculations are similarly daunting. <span>■</span></p>

然而，目前中国在住房改革上的方法胆小且零碎。从住房政策转向带来的任何红利都还遥不可及，全面的社会福利国家改革迹象也寥寥无几。

消费作为GDP的一部分可能会有所增加，因为大量的即将退休的工人将继续消费但停止生产。然而，与之相关的人口老龄化拖累对于增长几乎没有什么积极影响。

对于陈先生这样的经济安全基础薄弱的公民来说，这个等式只有一个方向指向。他今年51岁，离通常蓝领工人退休的年龄只有9年。但他必须照顾他的父母和他的小儿子。“一切都看我了。我不敢做数学。” 

对于中国政府来说，计算也同样令人胆寒。■
