<div></div><p><span>I</span><small>n November</small> Anthony Albanese, Australia’s prime minister, met Xi Jinping, China’s leader, in Beijing. Mr Xi declared that China and Australia had “embarked on the right path of improving relations” after years of estrangement. Just over two months later that path has a big pothole. On February 5th Yang Hengjun, an Australian citizen (pictured), was given a suspended death sentence by a Chinese court, after facing charges of espionage. </p>

在11月，澳大利亚总理安东尼·阿尔巴内塞在北京与中国领导人习近平会面。习主席表示，在多年疏远之后，中国和澳大利亚“走上了改善关系的正确道路”。仅仅过了两个多月，那条道路上出现了一个大坑。2月5日，澳大利亚公民杨恒军（图中所示）被中国法院判处无期徒刑，罪名是间谍活动。

Born in China, he may once have had ties to the country’s foreign or security ministries, though the foreign ministry says it never employed him. He was better known as a writer, publishing spy novels online and posting about democracy and human-rights abuses. He was detained in the city of Guangzhou in 2019. Two years later his trial began—behind closed doors. His death sentence could be commuted to life imprisonment after two years of good behaviour. Mr Yang denies the charges.</p>

杨先生的故事扑朔迷离。他出生于中国，可能曾与该国的情报或安全部门有过联系，尽管外交部声称从未雇佣过他。作为作家，他更为人所知，他在网上发布间谍小说，并谈论民主和人权侵犯问题。2019年，他在广州市被拘留。两年后，他的审判开始了——在闭门的情况下进行。经过两年的良好行为，他的死刑可能会减刑为无期徒刑。杨先生否认这些指控。


<p>Australia’s foreign minister, Penny Wong, said her government was “appalled” by the decision. The bilateral relationship has been fragile for years. Chinese leaders did not like Australia’s deepening security co-operation with America, its call for an inquiry into the origins of covid-19 and its decision to bar Huawei, a telecoms giant. China froze ministerial exchanges and embargoed some Australian exports. The intimidation tactics did not work and the arrival of Mr Albanese’s government in Australia in 2022 offered China a face-saving opportunity to back down.</p>

澳大利亚外交部长 Penny Wong 表示，她的政府对这一决定“感到震惊”。双边关系多年来一直脆弱。中国领导人不喜欢澳大利亚与美国深化的安全合作，以及呼吁调查新冠病毒起源的呼吁，并决定禁止华为这家电信巨头。中国冻结了部长级交流，并对一些澳大利亚出口实施禁运。恐吓策略并未奏效，而2022年阿尔巴内塞政府在澳大利亚上台为 China 提供了一个体面的机会来退一步。






<div><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p>One interpretation of Mr Yang’s sentence is that he is guilty. But China “would be rubbing Australia’s face” in the evidence, if they had any, says Dominic Meagher of the John Curtin Research Centre in Australia. Another theory is that China’s government is split. The resolution of a case similar to that of Mr Yang helped clear the way for better relations. In 2020 a Chinese-born Australian citizen called Cheng Lei was arrested in China. She had been working as an anchor on Chinese state television. Convicted of espionage (with few details given), Ms Cheng spent three years in prison before being released in October. </p>

杨先生那句话的一种解释是他有罪。然而，澳大利亚的约翰·库廷研究中心的研究员多米尼克·梅加赫表示，如果中国有任何证据的话，“这样做将会让澳大利亚感到脸上无光”。另一种理论是中国政府内部存在分歧。类似杨先生案件的解决有助于为改善关系扫清道路。2020年，一名出生于中国的澳大利亚公民程雷在中国被捕。她曾在中国官方电视台担任主播。程女士被判处间谍罪（但提供的细节很少），她在监狱中度过了三年时间，最后在10月份获释。


<p>Mr Yang’s sentence cuts against this precedent. It would have been approved by Communist Party leaders. Perhaps it indicates a struggle between competing bureaucracies. China’s diplomats seem to favour friendlier ties with Australia, while security officials are keen to show that Chinese who acquire foreign citizenship are not beyond their reach (China does not allow dual nationality).</p>

杨先生的判决似乎打破了这一先例。它本来会得到中共领导人的批准。也许，这标志着不同官僚机构之间的斗争。中国的外交官似乎更倾向于与澳大利亚发展更为友好的关系，而安全官员则热衷于表明，那些获取外国国籍的中国人并非不在他们的打击范围之内（中国不允许双重国籍）。


<p>The most obvious lesson is that the extent of any rapprochement was always going to be limited, given Australia’s alliance with America. That means even polite Chinese diplomacy is accompanied by a note of menace. Just after the conciliatory meeting between Mr Albanese and Mr Xi, the Chinese navy approached an Australian frigate in international waters, emitting sonar pulses that may have injured Australian divers. <span>■</span></p>

最明显的教训是，考虑到澳大利亚与美国的联盟关系，任何缓和程度总是有限的。这意味着即使是中国外交上的礼貌也是伴随着威胁的气息。就在阿博茨先生与习主席之间的和解会议之后不久，中国海军接近了澳大利亚在国际水域的护卫舰，并发射了可能伤害了澳大利亚潜水员的声纳脉冲。
