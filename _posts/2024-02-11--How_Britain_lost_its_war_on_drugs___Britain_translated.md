<div></div><p><span>A</span><small>s a general </small>practitioner (<small>gp</small>) in a deprived inner-city neighbourhood of Birmingham, Judith Yates had a close-up view of the evolution of Britain’s illegal drugs market. In the 1980s some of her poorest patients became addicted to Afghan heroin as it flooded the market. In the 1990s they made crack pipes from Coca-Cola cans and asthma inhalers. Some recovered. Others went in and out of prison, where they often became addicted to other drugs. Several died.</p>

作为伯明翰一个贫困市区的全科医生（GP），朱迪丝·耶茨近距离观察了英国非法毒品市场的发展演变。在1980年代，她的一些最贫穷的病人开始对涌入市场的阿富汗海洛因上瘾。到了1990年代，他们用可口可乐罐和哮喘吸入剂制作冰壶。有些人康复了。其他人进进出出监狱，在那里他们常常会对其他药物上瘾。其中一些人去世了。

What she found alarmed her. Drug deaths were increasing every year. And opioids were playing a big role.</p>

2010年，叶医生对政府在禁毒战争中进展甚微感到沮丧。于是，她开始访问当地法医办公室，收集有关毒品死亡的信息。“我想寻找模式，看看我们是否可以防止人们死亡。”她说。

她的发现让她震惊不已。每年都有越来越多的药物死亡案例。而阿片类药物起到的作用不可小觑。


<div><figure><span><img alt="" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/704/90/media-assets/image/20240210_BRC972.png"/></span></figure><p>In 2022 Dr Yates (by then retired but continuing her investigations) spotted the name of a drug on the coroner’s reports that she had not seen before: n-pyrrolidino etonitazene. This is one of a class of new synthetic opioids known as nitazenes which are at least as powerful as fentanyl (another synthetic opioid that is itself up to 50 times more powerful than heroin) and often many times more so (see chart). </p><p>The drug had been found in three young men who had died, two students and a businessman—quite different sorts of drug users from those Dr Yates was used to seeing in coroners’ reports. They had bought what appeared to be pharmaceutical-grade oxycodone (painkiller) pills online. “They would have thought they were self-medicating to reduce the stresses of life,” she says. “They certainly did not expect to die.” </p><p>Dr Yates’s experience is a microcosm of a wider crisis. Drug deaths in England and Wales have risen every year since 2012. In 2022, the most recent year for which there are data, the figure was 4,907, according to the Office for National Statistics (<small>ons</small>); 89% higher than in 2012. In that period some features of drug deaths have remained steady. Most victims are male (see chart). The north-east has the highest death rate. (Scotland, which is subject to the same laws but where drug deaths are counted separately, has one of the highest rates in Europe.) And the same generation—people born in the 1970s—are the likeliest to die.</p></div><div><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><div><figure><span><img alt="" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/662/90/media-assets/image/20240210_BRC282.png"/></span></figure><p>The vulnerability of this cohort is explained in part because in the last two decades of the 20th century more young people started using hard drugs, chiefly heroin and cocaine. These do more damage to the body as it ages. Deaths caused by cocaine, which has become increasingly popular as it has become cheaper, rose to 857 in 2022 from 112 in 2011. Drug-induced deaths may also be rising because it has become more common to take more than one substance at a time, which is likelier to be fatal. </p><p>But the most worrying part of the picture involves the consumption of synthetic opioids. Britain, like most of Europe, has so far sidestepped the <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/12/23/the-deaths-of-despair-narrative-is-out-of-date">opioid crisis that killed 70,000 Americans</a> last year alone. Because of its nationalised, non-profit-driven health-care system (in which doctors are generally responsible about prescribing opioids), it is unlikely to ever develop a problem as big as America’s.</p><p>Yet experts worry that an opioid crisis may nonetheless be looming because of changes to the global drugs trade. Most heroin in Europe comes from Afghanistan, where in 2021 the Taliban announced a ban on opium, a gum produced from poppies from which heroin is manufactured. Two missed poppy harvests later, the market for synthetic opioids such as nitazenes—which are relatively easy and cheap to manufacture (in China, it is thought) and then post—is said to be booming.</p><p>No one knows how many people in Britain have been killed by nitazenes. They have been detected in several dozen cases but are not always tested for. Meg Jones, director of Cranstoun, a charity, says nitazenes are being cut into many different sorts of drugs, often accidentally (because they are cut and packed on the same surface). In November the Home Office said it was decreeing 15 new drugs to be “class A”, the most dangerous sort. Most of them are nitazene compounds. </p></div><div><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p>Britain is singularly unprepared for an opioid crisis. Funding cuts in the 2010s have devastated drug-treatment programmes. In the second part of an independent, government-commissioned review into drugs published in 2021, Professor Carol Black, a doctor and academic, said that “funding cuts have left treatment and recovery services on their knees.” The workforce was “depleted, especially of professionally qualified people, and demoralised”. “The current situation is intolerable,” she said.</p>

英国对即将到来的阿片类药物危机毫无准备。2010年代的资金削减已经严重摧毁了药物治疗项目。在政府委托、独立进行的2021年发布的毒品问题调查报告的第二部分，医生和学者卡罗尔·布莱克教授表示，“资金削减使治疗和恢复服务陷入困境。”工作人员“数量减少，特别是专业资格人员，士气低落”。她指出，“当前的情况无法容忍。”


<p>The government has acknowledged that more investment in such services is needed. Yet it needs to do a lot more than restore what it has squandered. Since Britain passed the Drugs Misuse Act 1971, which criminalises possession of illicit drugs, it has taken a moralistic, punitive attitude to drug use that has achieved little.</p>

政府已承认，这类服务需要更多投资。但它所做的远不止恢复被浪费的一切。自从英国在1971年通过《毒品滥用法》将非法药物的持有定为犯罪以来，英国对吸毒采取了一种道德主义和惩罚性的态度，但收效甚微。


<p>Britain remains one of the few countries in Europe that does not have safe drug-consumption rooms (though one is due to <a href="https://www.economist.com/britain/2023/09/21/britain-explores-softening-its-war-on-drugs">open in Scotland</a> soon). That is because to run one could mean being charged with a crime. Research suggests such places do not increase drug use but help users enrol in other treatment. They are, moreover, a low-cost intervention, requiring little more than a room, a health-care worker and a supply of overdose medications. Yet Rishi Sunak, the prime minister, has said they “condone use of drugs”.</p>

英国仍然是欧洲少数几个没有安全药物消费室的国家（尽管苏格兰很快将开设一处）。这是因为运营这样的场所可能意味着被指控犯罪。

研究表明，这些地方并不会增加吸毒量，而是帮助使用者加入其他治疗计划。此外，它们还是一种低成本的干预措施，只需要一间房间、一名医疗保健工作者和过量药物供应即可。

然而，首相里希·苏纳克曾表示，这些场所“认可使用毒品”。


<p>There has been some progress. Police forces increasingly carry naloxone, an opioid antidote. Once only available in injectable form, it is now available as a nasal spray. Officers prefer using this to giving drug addicts <small>cpr</small>. (Multiple doses may be needed to save someone who has taken nitazenes.) Last month The Loop, a charity, opened the first Home Office-licensed drug-testing site, in Bristol. It will allow users to submit samples of illegal drugs; if there are concerns about the potency and purity of substances, local authorities can send public-health alerts and the buyer can be offered advice and treatment. More such centres are crucial. </p>

已经取得了一些进展。警方越来越多地携带纳洛酮（opioid反剂），它以前只能以注射形式获得，现在也可以作为鼻喷雾使用。警官们更喜欢使用这种方法，而不是给吸毒者做心肺复苏。（如果有人服用了氮卓类药物，可能需要多次剂量才能救人。）上个月，慈善机构The Loop开设了英国第一个经内政部许可的毒品检测站点，位于布里斯托尔。它允许用户提交非法药物的样本；如果有任何关于物质浓度和纯度的关注，地方当局可以发出公共卫生警报，并为买家提供咨询和治疗建议。需要更多这样的中心。


<p>In a rapidly evolving drug market information is power, says Dr Yates. She would, for instance, like the government to find a way to hasten the dissemination of information about drug deaths, which are usually certified by coroners. The <small>ons</small> says that record delays in inquests mean 64% of deaths that were registered in 2022 actually occurred in previous years. If Britain does have an opioid crisis, it may not find out before it is too late. <span>■</span></p>

在快速变化的毒品市场中，信息就是力量，Yates博士这样说道。例如，她希望政府能够找到方法来加速关于药物致死的信息传播。这些死亡通常由验尸官认证。

Theonss提出，审讯记录的延误导致了64%的2022年注册死亡实际上发生在前几年。如果英国确实存在阿片类危机，那么在为时已晚之前可能都不会发现这一点。■
