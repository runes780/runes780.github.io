<div></div><p><span>B</span><small>ritain has</small> always been interested in its kings’ bodies. Each age has had its own particular obsession. For Shakespeare, it was the king’s head—the mortal brow beneath the hollow crown—that fascinated. After the Restoration it was the king’s hand—Charles II was believed to be able to heal diseases by touch alone. Now national attention has turned to the state of <a href="https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/09/15/what-sort-of-king-will-charles-iii-be">Charles III’s</a> health. </p>

英国一直以来都对国王的身体充满兴趣。每个时代都有其特定的痴迷点。对于莎士比亚来说，吸引他的是国王的头颅——那具凡人的额头下戴着空洞的王冠。

在复辟时期，人们关注的是国王的手——查理二世被认为仅凭触摸就能治愈疾病。

现在，全国的目光都聚焦于查尔斯三世健康状况的状态上。


<p>According to a statement from Buckingham Palace on February 5th, “a separate issue of concern was noted” while the king was being treated for an enlarged prostate. Subsequent tests “identified a form of cancer”. Quite which form has not been announced; a little royal distance remains. But when future historians come to chronicle the change from a “magical” monarchy, able to heal by touch alone, to the more humdrum mortal kind, this moment may feature: few things seem more mortal or less magical than a prostate. </p>

据白金汉宫于2月5日发布的一份声明，当国王因前列腺增大接受治疗时，“注意到一个单独但令人关注的问题”。随后的测试“识别出一种癌症形式”。然而，具体是哪种类型的癌症并未公布；皇室仍保持着一些距离。不过，未来的历史学家在描述从“神奇”到“平凡”的王权转变时，这一刻可能会有这样的描绘：没有什么比前列腺更能体现生命的凡庸或奇迹了。


<div><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p>In the past monarchies have been less willing to admit to frailty, as have their physicians. When George VI had his entire left lung removed in 1951 because of lung cancer, the public (and indeed the king himself) were told that this was due to “structural abnormalities”. When his grandfather, the high-living Edward VII, collapsed in Biarritz, it was at once entirely unsurprising—Edward smoked, drank and ate so abundantly that he couldn’t do up the bottom buttons on his waistcoat—and, at first, entirely unspoken about. An attempt to treat the king was made, including through the application of his favourite mistress. But even she failed to revive him. </p>

在过去，君主们不太愿意承认自己的虚弱，而他们的医生也是如此。1951年，由于肺癌，乔治六世的整个左肺叶被切除时，公众（以及实际上国王本人）被告知这是由于“结构异常”。当他的祖父、享乐之王爱德华七世在比亚里茨倒下时，这一切立刻显得毫不意外——爱德华吸烟、饮酒且饮食过量，以至于他无法扣上背心上的最下面几颗纽扣。起初，这完全是一个不言而喻的秘密。尝试治疗国王的努力被尝试，包括通过给他最喜欢的情妇使用药物的方式。但即使是她也未能让他复苏。


<p>The monarch’s mortality feels all the more salient when they come to the throne late. Elizabeth II ascended to the throne at the age of 25; when the congregation at her coronation in 1953 sang “Long to reign over us” they could feel confident that she, with the pinchably plump flesh of youth, would do just that. In contrast, at his coronation last year Charles—the longest-serving heir-apparent—was already 74. </p>

当一位君主在很晚的时候登基，其去世的可能性就显得更加突出。例如，伊丽莎白二世在25岁时即位；1953年她加冕典礼上的教众们唱起“愿你长久统治我们”时，他们确信这位青春丰润的女王会履行这一承诺。相比之下，去年查尔斯国王加冕时，作为皇位继承人时间最长的他已年届74。


<p>A monarch is not a country incarnate but they are not far off. If <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/09/08/the-death-of-elizabeth-ii-marks-the-end-of-an-era">Elizabeth II</a>—dutiful, stable and influential—embodied one era, it feels uncomfortably as though Charles III—also dutiful, but ageing and now battling ill health—might represent another. Then again, as Shakespeare makes clear, a king is also just a man. The crown might be bejewelled; the royal crest might sit on the press releases. But the king beneath is mortal, and increasingly open about it. <span>■</span></p>

一位君主并非国家的化身，但他们确实紧密相关。如果说伊丽莎白二世——忠诚、稳定且有影响力——代表了一个时代，那么查尔斯三世（同样忠诚，但年事已高，现在正与健康问题作斗争）似乎预示着另一个时代。然而，正如莎士比亚所明确指出的那样，国王也只是凡人而已。

皇冠可能镶嵌着宝石；皇家徽章或许会出现在新闻发布稿上。但是，藏在这一切背后的君主是有限生命的，而且越来越愿意公开讨论这些问题。■
