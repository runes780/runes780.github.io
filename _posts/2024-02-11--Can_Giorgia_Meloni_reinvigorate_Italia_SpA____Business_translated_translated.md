<div></div><p><span>P</span><small>rominently displayed</small> at a bookshop at Linate airport in Milan is the cover of <i>Quando eravamo i padroni del mond</i>o (When we were the masters of the world). The book about the Roman empire has been on the bestseller list since it was published in September. It reflects Italians’ nostalgic longing for their now rather ancient glory. They could take solace from the fact that many Italian brands are still masters of the world: think fast cars (Ferrari, Maserati, Lamborghini), elegant motorcycles (Ducati, Vespa), beautiful clothes (Gucci, Prada, Zegna) and accessories to go with them (Fendi, Bottega Veneta). </p>

在米兰莱纳特机场的书店里，显眼地展示着一本书的封面——《当我们是世界的主人时》（When we were the masters of the world）。自九月份出版以来，这本书就一直位列畅销书排行榜。它反映出意大利人对昔日辉煌怀有的怀旧之情。尽管现在这些荣耀显得有些古老，但他们仍能从中得到慰藉。

许多意大利品牌至今仍是世界之主：想想那些快速的跑车（法拉利、玛莎拉蒂、兰博基尼）、优雅的摩托车（杜卡迪、维斯帕）；还有那令人眼花缭乱的时尚服饰（古驰、普拉达、杰尼亚），以及搭配它们的各种配饰（芬迪、葆腾威尼斯）。这些品牌代表了意大利在世界舞台上的独特地位和影响力。

Many are either incorporated abroad, listed elsewhere or owned by foreigners. And taken together, they lag behind those from other big European countries in terms of value. Italy’s 30 biggest brands are collectively worth just a third of Germany’s top 30 and a quarter of France’s, according to Kantar, a research firm. </p>

意大利令人垂涎的众多品牌和标签如今鲜有真正的意大利血统。许多公司要么在国外注册、在其他地方上市，要么被外国人所拥有。总体来看，在价值上这些意大利品牌落后于来自其他大型欧洲国家的品牌。根据市场研究公司Kantar的数据，意大利最大的30个品牌总价值仅为德国顶级30品牌的三分之一，且为法国同类品牌的四分之一。


<h2>Uffa!</h2><p>Corporate Italy more broadly likewise punches below the country’s signature braggadocio. The entire Italian stockmarket is worth less than €800bn ($860bn), barely twice the market capitalisation of <small>LVMH</small>, the French owner of several Italian luxury brands (including Fendi). The Milan bourse is smaller than those in Paris and Frankfurt relative to each country’s <small>GDP</small> (see chart 1). In the past ten years it has underperformed them, too (see chart 2). Just five of the world’s 500 biggest companies by revenue hail from Italy, down from 13 in 1997; 136 are American, 30 are German and 23 are French. Even Spain, whose economy is a third smaller than Italy’s, has 11 firms on the list. “Italians are world-class at creating companies but they are not good at managing and growing them,” says Stefano Caselli, dean of the Bocconi School of Management in Milan. </p>

全文翻译：

意大利企业界，更广泛地说也是如此，表现远低于该国标志性的夸耀。整个意大利股市的市值不足8000亿欧元（约8600亿美元），仅略高于法国奢侈品集团LVMH（拥有多个意大利奢侈品牌，包括芬迪）的市值两倍。米兰证券交易所相对于各自国家的GDP而言规模较小（见图表1）。过去十年中，它在表现上也落后于它们（见图表2）。全球500强企业中，只有五家来自意大利，相比1997年的13家有所下降；有136家来自美国，30家来自德国，23家来自法国。即使西班牙，其经济规模仅为意大利的三分之一，也有11家企业位列名单之中。“意大利人在创建公司方面是世界级的，但他们并不擅长管理和增长这些公司。”米兰博科尼商学院管理学院长Stefano Caselli说。

Giorgia Meloni. Her right-wing government wants to recreate Italian champions in industries from cars and energy to food and fashion. On February 6th it pushed a capital-markets bill through the lower house of parliament. It is meant to lure more listings to the Milan stock exchange, pre-empt hostile takeovers and prevent big companies from incorporating in places like the Netherlands (corporate home to Ferrari, whose biggest shareholder, Exor, also part-owns <i>The Economist</i>’s parent company). </p><p>The bill’s advocates argue it would remove a big obstacle to the creation of corporate behemoths—Italy’s shallow capital markets. Critics warn it may have the opposite effect. Fully 95% of shareholders in Italian listed firms are foreign, says Dario Trevisan, a lawyer who represents institutional investors. And the foreigners fear that the bill favours Italians, by allowing public companies to grant long-term shareholders, who tend to be domestic, shares with outsize voting rights and, if their stake is more than 9%, the ability to veto some board appointments. </p></div><div><figure><span><img alt="" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/1175/90/media-assets/image/20240210_WBC318.png"/></span></figure><p>Italian business could certainly do with a deeper pool of capital. In its absence, many companies have no choice but to rely on bank loans to finance their growth. This is also true in other European countries, including Germany. What distinguishes Italy is that many of its bosses actually prefer borrowing from lenders to sharing power with other equity holders, says Andrea Alemanno of Ipsos, a research firm in Milan. Like Julius Caesar, Mr Alemanno remarks poetically, they would rather be first in a barbarian village than second in Rome. All too often, the result is that companies take on too much debt and go bust or get taken over by the government. </p><p>The alternative is to stay small. Italy has 4.3m companies with fewer than 250 employees. That is a third more than Germany, an economy twice the size that is home to the world-famous <i>Mittelstand</i> of small and medium-sized businesses. Such firms are responsible for 80% of employment and 70% of value-added in Italy, compared with, respectively, 56% and 43% in Germany. Around 95% of them have fewer than ten employees. These microenterprises, which tend to be far less productive than larger companies, employ roughly one in two Italian workers.</p><p>“We have a strong layer of companies with 100 to 500 employees, but beyond that it gets very thin,” admits Corrado Passera, a former economy minister who runs Illimity, a bank specialised in lending to small and medium-sized Italian firms. He and his family are nevertheless big believers in <i>il bel paese</i> and its spirit of enterprise. His wife built a network of veterinary clinics and his son founded a hotel business. </p><p>Setting up a company in Italy is both fun and easy, insists Mr Passera, especially if you are a technology entrepreneur. In 2012 the government in which he served passed the Startup Act, packed with incentives aimed at nurturing innovative tech firms. Businesses which qualify are exempt from fees for online incorporation, as well as some duties and taxes, and can take advantage of expedited visa procedures for their international staff and tax incentives for their investors.</p></div><div><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p>Mr Passera’s high spirits notwithstanding, Italy has yet to create a <i>Valle del Silicio</i> to rival equivalents elsewhere in Europe, let alone the American original<i>.</i> Italy has the world’s tenth-biggest economy but ranks outside the top 20 even among European countries in terms of investment in startups, according to Sifted, an online publication that tracks such things. It has produced just two unlisted tech firms valued at $1bn or more (both in fintech). With luck, it may breed another one soon. Bending Spoons, which helps clients design apps, has so far raised over $500m, according to PitchBook, a data provider. But even that would leave it behind Spain, which boasts four such “unicorns”. Germany has 33 and France 24. </p>

尽管Passera先生情绪高涨，但意大利至今还没有创造出能与欧洲其他地区相媲美的“硅谷”（Valle del Silicio）。更不用说与美国的原始版本抗衡了。

根据追踪此类数据的在线出版物Sifted的数据，意大利拥有全球第十大经济体，但在初创企业的投资方面，它甚至未能进入欧洲国家的前20名。它只孵化出两家未上市的科技公司，价值超过10亿美元（两者均在金融科技领域）。

希望凭借运气，很快就能培育出另一家类似的公司。帮助客户设计应用的Bending Spoons公司至今已筹集超过50亿美元的资金，据数据提供商PitchBook的数据表明。但即便如此，它仍将落后于西班牙——这个国家拥有四家这样的“独角兽”企业。德国有33家，“独角兽”数量法国仅次于德国，为24家。


<p>Other promising Italian startups, like many of those beloved Italian brands, are seeking their fortune abroad. Newcleo, founded by three Italians, is developing novel lead-cooled nuclear reactors. It has so far raised €400m ($430m). Its research-and-development centre is located in Turin. But its headquarters are in London. That is because after a referendum in 1987 Italy phased out nuclear energy, which means no demand for its products in its home market. Ms Meloni might try to phase it back in as part of its clean-energy transition. Then again, she might not—decisiveness isn’t Italian governments’ forte.</p>

其他有潜力的意大利初创公司，就像那些深受喜爱的意大利品牌一样，正在国外寻找机遇。Newcleo由三位意大利人创立，正在开发新型采用铅冷却的核反应堆。迄今为止，他们已经筹集了40亿欧元（43亿美元）。他们的研发中心位于都灵，但总部设在伦敦。这是因为1987年意大利举行公投后，逐步淘汰了核能，这意味着在国内市场上没有对产品的需求。梅洛尼女士可能会尝试将其重新引入清洁能源转型的一部分。不过也有可能不会这样做——决断力并不是意大利政府的强项。


<p>A heavy regulatory burden and legislative uncertainty are a problem not just for atomic startups. All of Italy’s businesses struggle with the same challenges, says Andrea Bonomi, chairman of Investindustrial, a private-equity firm based in London and focused on Italian companies. If Ms Meloni wants Italia SpA to thrive, that is where she should focus her attention. <span>■</span></p>

沉重的监管负担和立法不确定性不仅困扰着原子初创公司。意大利所有企业都面临着同样的挑战，伦敦私人股本投资公司Investindustrial的主席安德里亚·波诺米(Andrea Bonomi)说。如果梅洛尼女士希望Italia SpA蓬勃发展，那才是她应该集中精力的地方。■
