<div></div><p><span>W</span><small>HEN THE SUPREME COURT</small> decided <i>Bush v Gore</i> a generation ago, five justices in effect handed George W. Bush the presidency over Al Gore. The implications of<i> Trump v Anderson</i>, which the court heard on February 8th, could be similarly momentous. But this time the justices are wary of making a splash in <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2024/02/04/trumps-lead-over-biden-may-be-smaller-than-it-looks">a presidential election</a> and of splitting their votes along ideological lines. By the end of the oral argument, a consensus seemed to have emerged: despite his role in the events of January 6th 2021, Colorado will very probably not be allowed to remove Mr Trump from its ballot, nor will the other 49 states in this year’s election.</p>

当 Supreme Court 在一代人以前的布什诉戈尔案中作出判决时，五位法官实际上将美国总统之位交给了乔治·W·布什，而不是阿尔·戈尔。二月八日，最高法院听取了特朗普诉安德森案。此案可能同样具有深远的影响。但这一次，法官们小心翼翼地避免在总统选举中引起轰动，并且不愿沿意识形态路线分裂投票。在口头辩论结束时，似乎达成了一致意见：尽管他参与了2021年1月6日事件，科罗拉多州很可能不会被允许从选票上移除特朗普先生，其他49个州在今年的选举中也不会受到影响。


<p>The historic hearing marked the first time the Supreme Court had considered the meaning and reach of Section 3 of the <a href="https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/09/20/could-the-14th-amendment-bar-donald-trump-from-becoming-president-again">14th Amendment</a>, a provision that bars officials from holding future public office if, after taking an oath supporting the constitution, they engage in “insurrection or rebellion”. When rioters stormed the Capitol trying to overturn the 2020 election, scholars pointed to this relic of the Reconstruction era—a tool originally designed to keep former Confederate leaders away from the levers of power. Voters and advocacy groups in at least 35 states emerged to contend that Donald Trump is a modern-day insurrectionist who should be disqualified from a second presidential term. </p>

历史性听证会标志着美国最高法院首次审议第14修正案第3条的含义和适用范围。该条款禁止官员在宣誓支持宪法后，如果参与“叛乱或反抗”，则不得再担任未来的公共职务。当示威者闯入国会大厦试图推翻2020年的选举结果时，学者们指出这是重建时期遗留的一个工具——最初是设计用来阻止前邦联领导人在权力杠杆上发挥作用的。至少在35个州，选民和维权团体联合起来，提出唐纳德·特朗普是一名现代意义上的叛乱者，应被取消第二个总统任期的资格。

Defending that decision at the federal Supreme Court, Jason Murray (representing a group of voters including Norma Anderson, a 91-year-old Republican) called January 6th a “violent assault” that was “incited by a sitting president of the United States”.</p>

尽管大多数州的法律努力停滞不前，但12月19日，科罗拉多州最高法院在裁定唐纳德·特朗普(Donald Trump)无资格参加3月5日该州共和党初选时，引用了第3条。杰森·墨菲(Jason Murray，代表包括91岁的老共和党人诺玛·安德森(Norma Anderson)在内的选民群体)在联邦最高法院为捍卫这一决定辩护时，称1月6日是一场“暴力袭击”，这场袭击是“由美国总统现任总统煽动的”。


<p>This was one of few moments in two hours of wrangling that recalled the mayhem that transpired across the street from the Supreme Court three years ago. The hearing was dominated by bloodless parsing of legal technicalities and worries about what would happen if the Colorado court’s ruling stood.</p>

在长达两个小时的争论中，这一幕是为数不多的几回，让人联想到三年前，在最高法院街对面发生的一片混乱。听证会充斥着对法律技术细节的枯燥分析，以及对科罗拉多法庭裁决如果站不住脚会发生什么的担忧。


<p>In his opening pitch, Jonathan Mitchell, Mr Trump’s lawyer, did not say a word about January 6th. He did not deny that the riot was an “insurrection” (though he did, half-heartedly, later on). At no point did he offer a defence of his client’s behaviour. Instead, he said Section 3 does not apply to Mr Trump because a “president is not ‘an officer of the United States’ as that term is used throughout the constitution”. (An officer, he later explained, is a “term of art” applying “only to those who are appointed, not to those who are elected”.) Mr Mitchell also cast doubt on a state’s power to remove a presidential candidate from the ballot based on Section 3. The second sentence of that provision permits Congress to lift the ban by a two-thirds vote. So by prematurely removing a candidate from the ballot, a state is “accelerating the deadline to meet a constitutionally imposed qualification” and disenfranchising “potentially tens of millions of Americans”.</p>

在开场陈述中，特朗普的律师乔纳森·米切尔对于1月6日的事情只字未提。他并未否认暴乱是一场“叛乱”（尽管后来他有些勉强地提到了这一点）。在整个过程中，他都没有为客户的所作所为进行辩护。相反，他说根据第3款，特朗普总统不受该条款约束，因为“总统并不是‘美国的官员’，如宪法中各处使用的术语所示”。（他随后解释说，“官员”是一个技术术语，仅适用于那些被任命的人，而不包括选举产生的人员。）米切尔还质疑一个州是否有权力根据第3款从选票上移除总统候选人。该条款第二部分允许国会通过三分之二的投票解除禁令。因此，一个州如果过早地将候选人从选票上剔除，就是在“加速符合宪法规定资格的截止日期”，并剥夺了“数千万美国人的选举权”。


<div><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p>Justices from right to left voiced scepticism about entrusting states with the power to disqualify presidential aspirants. Justice Brett Kavanaugh made much of <i>Griffin’s</i> case, an 1869 circuit-court ruling that said Section 3 could not be applied unless Congress passed a law permitting the removal of insurrectionists. Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas noted that states have used Section 3 to disqualify candidates only for state, not federal, offices. The chief justice, John Roberts, looked to the purpose of the 14th Amendment: isn’t its “whole point”, he asked Mr Murray, ”to restrict state power”? Empowering states to disqualify candidates at will seems to be “at war” with that aim. If states cynically nix candidates from their ballots, elections could end up turning on just a “handful of states”. That, he warned, would be “a pretty daunting consequence”.</p>

从右至左，法官们对将排除总统候选人资格的权力交给各州表示怀疑。布雷特·卡瓦诺法官着重提到了格里芬案（Griffin’s case），这是1869年巡回法院的一项裁决，指出第3条除非国会通过法律允许移除叛乱分子，否则不能适用。

塞缪尔·艾利奥特和克拉伦斯·托马斯大法官指出，各州曾使用第3条排除候选人，但这仅限于州级而非联邦职位。首席法官约翰·罗伯茨则关注到第14修正案的目的：他询问梅雷迪思·穆雷（Murray）女士，“它的整个目标不就是限制州权力吗？”。

赋予各州随意排除候选人的权力似乎与这一目标“处于冲突状态”。如果各州出于恶意从选票上剔除候选人，选举结果可能仅取决于少数几个州。他警告说，这将是“一个相当令人不安的后果”。


<p>It was not only the six-justice conservative majority who were uncomfortable with Colorado’s erasing Mr Trump from the ballot. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson eyed the list of offices Section 3 prohibits oath-breakers from holding and noticed that “president” and “vice-president” are not among them. Justice Elena Kagan amplified Chief Justice Roberts’s worries about the disarray that would follow from 50 states each having a say on who qualifies for the ballot. “Why should a single state”, she asked Mr Murray (who clerked for her a decade ago), “have the ability to make this determination not only for their own citizens but for the rest of the nation?”</p>

不仅是由六名保守法官组成的多数派，科罗拉多州撤销特朗普的选票资格也让其他人士感到不安。大法官凯坦吉·布朗·杰克逊注意到第3节禁止叛誓者担任的职务列表，她注意到"总统"和"副总统"都不在其中。埃琳娜·卡根大法官进一步强调了首席大法官约翰·罗伯茨对50个州各自决定选民资格可能导致混乱的担忧。卡根问梅里尔（十年前曾是她的书记员）：“为什么单个州应该有能力做出这样的决定，不仅是为他们的公民，更是为了全国其他地方的人？”


<p>Justice Sonia Sotomayor looks to be the only possible dissenting voice on a bench unwilling to approve a new regime of states making independent judgments about candidates’ fitness under Section 3. With primary season under way, the court is probably keen to allay confusion. The answer could come uncharacteristically swiftly for a court that normally takes months to rule: the justices are next scheduled to appear in the courtroom on February 16th.<span>■</span></p>

由于初选已经开始，法院可能会急于消除任何困惑。答案可能来自一个通常需要数月才能作出裁决的法院非同寻常地迅速出现：大法官们下一次预定在法庭上露面是在2月16日。■
