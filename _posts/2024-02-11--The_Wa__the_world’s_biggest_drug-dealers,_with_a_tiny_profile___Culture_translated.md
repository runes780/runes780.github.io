# The Wa: the world’s biggest drug-dealers, with a tiny profile | Culture

Hard-up farmers in remote villages grow illicit cash crops (<a href="https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2023/08/04/parts-of-colombia-are-now-awash-with-cocaine">coca</a> plants and opium poppies can be cultivated even in poor soil). Local criminals muscle in. Trafficking syndicates spring up to ship the processed narcotics to the rich world. As profits rise, the cartel has to fight off competition. It bribes and threatens officials to ignore its activities. </p><p>The pattern has been repeated from <a href="https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2021/09/01/what-does-taliban-control-mean-for-afghanistans-opium-economy">Afghanistan</a> to<a href="https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2023/05/11/mexicos-gangs-are-becoming-criminal-conglomerates"> Mexico</a>, but only one place has become a fully fledged narco-state. Wa State, a mountainous region within Myanmar, near China, is home to the Wa, an ethnic group comprising around 1m people. It spans roughly the same amount of land as the Netherlands. It declared de facto independence from Myanmar in 1989; today it is governed by the United Wa State Army (<small>UWSA</small>) under one-party socialist rule. (It is not recognised internationally.)</p><div><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p>Since the late 1980s the <small>UWSA</small> has dominated the business of peddling meth in South-East Asia. (The <small>UN </small>estimated in 2019 that trade of the drug in East and South-East Asia was worth $30bn-61bn a year.) It started out cultivating opium, graduated to making heroin and now cooks some of the world’s best methamphetamine. This pays for an army larger than Sweden’s, which is well stocked with high-tech weaponry.</p><p>“Just as Haiti was built on sugar and Saudi Arabia on oil, Wa State was built on heroin and methamphetamine,” writes Patrick Winn in “Narcotopia”. Yet the “<small>UWSA</small> isn’t some jungle-dwelling mafia. It’s running an honest-to-God nation.” The rogue ethnostate collects taxes. It has its own hospitals, schools and electricity grid, and its roads are better paved than many in Myanmar. Members of its Politburo are chummy with the Chinese government, and the state maintains an informal embassy in Myanmar. Wa citizens sing their own anthem and live under their own flag.</p><p>Mr Winn, a correspondent for The World, a show on National Public Radio, has covered Asia’s fluid borders for years. His previous book, “Hello, Shadowlands”, peeked at the <small>UWSA</small> as part of a broader look at rebel fiefdoms. “Narcotopia” is a more detailed examination. Though Mr Winn’s attempts to smuggle himself into Wa State were thwarted by the pandemic, he manages to interview leaders including Saw Lu, an anti-drug evangelical who became the <small>UWSA</small>’s first foreign minister. The elderly official recounts how he failed to wean his government off narco-dollars.</p><p>America bears much of the blame, Mr Winn argues. Dredging up little-known research, he sets out how the <small>CIA </small>sponsored various opium-smugglers in Myanmar in the 1950s-70s. In exchange for guns and legal immunity, these warlords doubled as anti-communist militia bosses, gathering intelligence and launching raids into <a href="https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2019/03/28/the-enduring-influence-of-mao-zedong">Maoist</a> China. Langley thwarted attempts to arrest top capos and even lent them spy planes to move dope. The agency would repeat these deals with Nicaraguan rebels in the 1980s, igniting the Iran-Contra scandal.</p><div><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p>In portraying Washington’s grimy role in the Wa saga, Mr Winn sometimes skims over the actions of others.<!-- --> China acts as the <small>UWSA</small>’s protector, giving it arms in exchange for not smuggling drugs into the country. Myanmar’s generals have granted Wa State carte blanche so long as it does not seek recognition from the <small>UN</small>. </p><p>Even so, the book offers a rich analysis of narco-states. The <small>UWSA </small>produces bright pink, sweet-smelling meth pills that are triumphs of branding: the “<small>WY</small>” logo is “as recognisable...as Nike’s swoosh”, Mr Winn claims. Asia’s partying youngsters and exhausted workers consume billions every year. Wa State is not so much a den of vice, the author argues, as a nest of realpolitik and innovation. <span>■</span></p><br /><hr /><div>获取更多RSS：<br /><a href="https://feedx.net" style="color: orange;" target="_blank">https://feedx.net</a> <br /><a href="https://feedx.run" style="color: orange;" target="_blank">https://feedx.run</a><br /></div>
