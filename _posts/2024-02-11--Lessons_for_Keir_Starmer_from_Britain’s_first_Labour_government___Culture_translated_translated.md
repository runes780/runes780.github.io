<p><span>I</span><small>T</small> <small>SEEMS all </small>but certain that the Labour Party will win the British <a href="https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2023/11/13/rishi-sunak-and-sir-keir-starmer-who-would-actually-bring-change">election</a>, expected later this year. Rishi Sunak’s Conservatives are lagging in the polls, consumed by <a href="https://www.economist.com/britain/2024/02/01/the-search-for-conservative-party-unity">in-fighting and division</a>. All this makes for a propitious moment to assess the first-ever Labour government, which took office in January 1924. The leader of the opposition, Sir Keir Starmer, himself christened after Labour’s first leader, Keir Hardie, could learn from the story.</p>

似乎几乎可以肯定，工党将在今年晚些时候举行的英国选举中获胜。里希·苏纳克领导的保守党在民调中落后，内部斗争和分裂消耗了大量精力。这一切都为评估有史以来首个工党政权提供了有利时机。该政府于1924年1月上台。反对党领袖基尔·施特拉默爵士本人就以工党的首位领导人基尔·哈代的名字命名的，他可以从这个故事中汲取智慧。

The minority Labour government, led by Ramsay MacDonald (pictured), lasted only nine months, during which it managed to make some progress with reforms in areas ranging from welfare to education and health. But its principal achievement was simply to demonstrate that, contrary to loud claims by Tories, Labour was fit to govern. In doing this, MacDonald paved the way for the collapse of the Liberal Party in the election of October 1924, creating the two-party system that has largely prevailed ever since.</p>

在《野人》一文中，记者大卫·托兰斯回顾了工党如何在执政之初震撼政治体制。由拉姆齐·麦克唐纳领导的少数派工党政府仅维持了9个月，在此期间，政府致力于在福利、教育、卫生等领域推行改革，取得了一些进展。然而，其主要成就仅仅是证明：与保守党的高调言论相反，工党完全有能力胜任执政。通过这项工作，麦克唐纳为1924年10月的选举中自由党派的崩溃铺平了道路，从而形成了自那以后主导政坛的两党制度。


<div><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p>Even such a short period in office offers useful lessons for later Labour governments. One was the fiscal austerity shown by Philip Snowden as chancellor of the exchequer. Contrary to the usual charge that Labour is addicted to taxing and spending, in office the party has often held down public expenses, partly to protect the value of the pound. In the 1920s Labour scotched plans for a Channel tunnel. Rachel Reeves, today’s shadow chancellor, promises to be similarly austere.</p>

即使是短短的在任期，也为后来工党的政府提供了有益的教训。其中一个是菲利普·斯诺登担任财政大臣期间展现的财政紧缩。这与通常对工党提出税收和开支成瘾的说法相反。实际上，工党内阁往往控制公共开支，部分目的是保护英镑的价值。

在20世纪20年代，工党否决了修建英吉利海峡隧道的计划。今天的影子财政大臣雷切尔·里夫斯承诺将同样持节俭态度。


<p>A second lesson is the big role that Labour leaders often find themselves playing in foreign affairs. MacDonald, who was his own foreign secretary (exhausting himself in the process), presided over two big European conferences to settle diplomatic and economic problems caused by the first world war. Once again, later Labour leaders have followed suit: Clement Attlee helped to set up <small>NATO</small> in 1949; Harold Wilson pulled British troops back from east of Suez in 1968; and <a href="https://www.economist.com/britain/2023/07/20/sir-tony-blair-mesmerises-the-labour-party-again">Sir Tony Blair</a>, who served as leader of the Labour Party from 1994 to 2007, carved out a big—and not always successful—global role.</p>

第二个教训是，工党领袖常常在外交事务中扮演重要角色。麦克唐纳担任自己的外交大臣（这使他精疲力竭），主持了两次重要的欧洲会议，以解决第一次世界大战引发的外交和经济问题。后来的工党领导人也遵循这一模式：克莱门特·艾登帮助建立了北约（1949年）；哈罗德·威尔逊在1968年将英国军队撤出西太平洋以东地区；以及从1994年至2007年担任工党领袖的托尼·布莱尔，他为自己打造了一个在全球范围内的大角色——尽管并非总能取得成功。


<p>And third is Labour’s tradition of treating its leaders as betrayers of the party’s fundamental beliefs. MacDonald was criticised by his political peers for not being sufficiently committed to socialism; he was later branded a traitor for forming a national government with the Tories in the 1930s. Wilson was similarly attacked as unprincipled. As for Sir Tony, despite his three election victories, many in the party still hate him today. Only Attlee seems secure in Labour’s pantheon.</p>

第三点是工党对待其领导人的传统，即视他们为背叛了党的基本信念的叛徒。麦克唐纳因其对社会主义不够坚定而受到政治同行的批评；后来他在20世纪30年代与保守党建立国民政府时被贴上了“叛徒”的标签。威尔逊也同样遭到无原则攻击。至于托尼爵士，尽管他赢得了三次大选胜利，但党内今天仍有许多人讨厌他。只有艾德礼在工党的神庙中显得安全。


<p>Sir Keir, who has weeded out many of those most closely linked to <a href="https://www.economist.com/britain/2023/10/24/liz-truss-and-jeremy-corbyn-still-haunt-british-politics">Jeremy Corbyn</a>, his far-left predecessor as party leader, may have his work cut out to avoid being seen by some in the party as just another traitor. He could do worse than read this book to ponder what history can teach. <span>■</span></p>

Keir爵士在党内已经清除了很多与他的前任、极左翼的党魁Jeremy Corbyn关系密切的人。他要避免被一些党内人士视为又一个背叛者，可能会面临艰巨的任务。他如果真想从中汲取历史教训，最好读一读这本书。■
