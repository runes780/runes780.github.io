<div></div><p><span>T</span><small>he playground</small> rivalry between <a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2023/10/26/ai-has-rescued-mark-zuckerberg-from-a-metaverse-size-hole">Mark Zuckerberg</a> and <a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2023/12/05/elon-musks-messiah-complex-may-bring-him-down">Elon Musk</a> dates back years—and in who-is-cooler-than-whom terms, Mr Musk usually wins easily. As an innovator, Mr Zuckerberg, co-founder of Facebook and boss of Meta, a social-media giant, has often been dismissed as a geeky dilettante in a hoodie. He has never received the Promethean kudos Mr Musk has for turning Tesla into a stallion of electric vehicles (<small>EV</small>s) and SpaceX into a rocket sensation. Mr Zuckerberg is notorious for his motto “move fast and break things”, which may have helped Facebook conquer the world but gave licence to critics to cast it as a social menace. Mr Musk is revered as a rule-breaker, plays up his bad-boy image and mostly gets away with it. </p>

扎克伯格与马斯克之间的游乐场争斗已经持续多年。在谁比谁酷的竞争中，通常马斯克会轻松获胜。

作为创新者，Facebook的联合创始人、Meta（脸书母公司）的老板马克·扎克伯格常常被批评为穿着连帽衫的技术宅二流子。他从未像特斯拉CEO埃隆·马斯克那样因将特斯拉变成电动汽车行业的领头羊和SpaceX打造成火箭界的明星而受到普罗米修斯般的赞誉。

扎克伯格以“快速行动，打破事物”这一口号闻名遐迩。这可能有助于Facebook在全球范围内取得成功，但也为批评者提供了理由，使他们认为Facebook是一个社会威胁。

马斯克被誉为一个打破规则的人，他故意塑造自己桀骜不驯的形象，并且通常都能侥幸过关。


<p>Such was the tenor of their relationship when Mr Musk proposed a cage match with Mr Zuckerberg in June last year just before Meta launched a short-messaging app, Threads, to compete with Mr Musk’s Twitter (now X). Forget the physical fight that never happened. In business terms, even then Mr Musk had the upper hand. He was the richest man on Earth. Tesla’s market value, though falling, was higher than Meta’s. Its revenues were growing faster. Yet since then, he could not have kicked himself harder in the teeth. In the past few weeks Tesla has shocked investors with a horror-show earnings presentation. Mr Musk’s $56bn pay package from 2018 was rescinded by a judge, which has slashed his net worth. From America to China, his <small>EV</small>s have suffered recalls. </p>

在去年6月，即Meta推出竞品短消息应用Threads以对抗Twitter（现名X）之前，马斯克提出了与扎克伯格进行拳击比赛的提议。即使在那个商业层面上，马斯克似乎仍然占据优势。他是世界上最富有的人，特斯拉的市值虽然下跌，但仍高于Meta。其收入增长更快。然而从那以后，他的自责恐怕无以复加。在过去几周里，特斯拉让投资者大吃一惊，发布了一份令人震惊的财报表现。2018年马斯克获得的560亿美元薪酬方案被法官撤销，这大幅削减了他的净资产。无论是美国还是中国，他的电动汽车都遭遇了召回事件。


<div><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p>Mr Zuckerberg, meanwhile, is punching the air. On February 1st Meta released earnings showing a staggering rise in sales and margins. Its market value has reached $1.2trn, exactly the level Tesla achieved at its peak in 2021, and more than twice what the <small>EV</small>-maker is worth now. To be sure, short-term measures of financial performance are not everything. But look at longer-term factors, such as the way both men run their businesses, treat their shareholders and customers, and respond to their own failures, and it is clear the fight is as good as over. Zuck has won.</p>

同时，扎克伯格则在空中挥拳庆祝。2月1日，Facebook母公司Meta发布财报显示，销售量和利润率均实现惊人增长。Meta的市值已达到1.2万亿美元，与特斯拉2021年巅峰时的市值完全一致，更是当前电动汽车制造商特斯拉市值的两倍以上。

诚然，财务表现的短期衡量标准并非全部。但是，如果着眼于长期因素，比如这两位男士如何经营自己的企业、对待股东和客户的方式，以及他们面对自身失败的反应，那么很明显，这场战斗几乎已经结束。扎克取得了胜利。


<p>To understand why, start with the interplay between the way both gazillionaires control and run their companies. Each of them lords it over their firms in a way that makes corporate-governance advocates blanch: Mr Zuckerberg via a dual-share structure that gives him majority control of Meta; Mr Musk, by having everyone at Tesla in his thrall. But as Mr Zuckerberg has become more sensitive to his fellow shareholders, Mr Musk has become less so. That has had a big impact on performance.</p>

要理解这一点，首先要考虑亿万富翁们控制和运营公司的方式之间的互动。他们各自以让企业治理倡导者面色苍白的方式统治他们的公司：扎克伯格通过赋予他在Meta（Facebook的母公司）拥有多数控制权的双重股份结构；马斯克则通过将特斯拉（Tesla）的每个人都置于他的掌控之中。

然而，随着扎克伯格对公司其他股东的感受变得更加敏感，而马斯克却变得不那么敏感。这一转变对业绩产生了重大影响。


<p>Mr Zuckerberg’s <i>volte face</i> started in 2022 when shareholders recoiled at the way he was blowing their money (and his) on moonshot projects like the metaverse, just as Meta’s core business was slowing. Instead of ignoring them, he listened. Since then he has changed his tune to focus on cutting costs, boosting profits, and using the cash to invest in artificial intelligence (<small>AI)</small> and the metaverse in a way that improves existing products as well as funding futuristic bets. Moreover, to convince shareholders he is not wasting their money, Meta will return more cash to them via share repurchases and pay the company’s first-ever dividend. </p>

扎克伯格的转变始于2022年。当时，股东们对扎克伯格把他们的钱（和他自己的）投入到像元宇宙这样的远大目标项目上感到不满，尤其是因为Facebook的核心业务正在放缓。

扎克伯格没有忽视这些反馈，而是倾听并作出了调整。从那以后，他改变了策略，专注于削减成本、提高利润，并利用这些资金投资于人工智能（AI）和元宇宙，以改善现有产品，并资助未来的押注。

此外，为了打消股东们的疑虑，认为他们的钱没有被浪费，Facebook将在股份回购中返还更多的现金给股东们，并支付公司有史以来的首次股息。


<p>Mr Musk has had no such epiphany. In the two years since Tesla’s share price peaked, he seems to have doubled down on disappointing fellow owners of the company’s stock. The sensible ones long for a cheap, mass-market <small>EV</small>. Instead Tesla is selling expensive ones at a margin-shredding discount. They want him to spend more time at Tesla, but he splits it with SpaceX and wastes it at (and on) X. They yearn for full-self-driving cars as the catalyst for a robotaxi revolution. Instead, even diehard fans were stunned recently when Mr Musk threatened to move his <small>AI</small> and robotics efforts away from Tesla unless he was given 25% voting control.</p>

马斯克先生却并未有这样的顿悟。自特斯拉股价高峰以来的两年里，他似乎在进一步压榨那些持有该公司股票的股东们，令他们大失所望。那些明智的人渴望看到一款价格低廉、大众化的电动汽车。然而，特斯拉却选择出售昂贵的车型，并以削薄利润的方式提供折扣。他们希望他能花更多时间在特斯拉上，但他把时间分给了SpaceX，还浪费在了（以及关于）X项目上。他们渴望能看到实现全自动驾驶汽车，作为机器人出租车革命的催化剂。然而，最近甚至连坚定的粉丝们也感到震惊：马斯克先生威胁称，如果他不获得25%的投票控制权，他将把人工智能和机器人技术的努力从特斯拉转移出去。


<div><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p>That leads to a second big difference: motivation, which was the crux of the judge’s decision in Delaware on January 30th to strip Mr Musk of his gargantuan pay cheque. Mr Zuckerberg, as the judgment noted, receives no salary or share options. His 13% economic stake in Meta is the main incentive to come to work each day. Mr Musk, however, is different. Though his Tesla shareholding at the time meant he would become $10bn richer every time Tesla’s value jumped by $50bn, that wasn’t enough. Tesla’s board (many of whom the judge ruled were too chummy with Mr Musk to be independent) convinced shareholders that an extra incentive was needed to keep his nose to the grindstone: namely, the biggest payout in the history of public markets. Now that it has been voided, his motivation, presumably, is even more in doubt.</p>

这引出了第二个重要的区别：动机。在1月30日， Delaware的法官作出裁决，剥夺马斯克那巨额薪酬的关键部分。正如判决所指出的那样，扎克伯格并不领取薪水或股票期权。他在Meta公司13%的经济权益是每天来工作的主要动力。然而，马斯克的情况有所不同。尽管当时他在特斯拉的持股意味着每当特斯拉市值增长500亿美元时，他就会变得比之前多出1000亿美元财富。但这还不足以激励他。特斯拉董事会（许多成员都被裁决与马斯科过于亲近，无法独立行事）说服股东们认为，为了让他继续专注于工作，还需要额外的动力：具体来说就是历史上最大的公众市场薪酬。现在既然它已经被撤销，他的动机，据推测，变得更加不确定了。


<p>Then there are both men’s attitudes to customers, which have also moved in opposite directions. Mr Zuckerberg was vilified for Facebook’s fast-and-loose approach to users’ data, content moderation and privacy. The concerns are still strong, especially when it comes to youngsters on social media. But Facebook now has an independent oversight board to rule on content decisions, and Meta says it has invested $20bn since 2016 in online safety. No doubt Mr Musk still has some loyalists as customers. But considering how many American <small>EV</small> owners lean Democratic, the more he rants on X, the more it is clear that he disdains their political opinions. The latest recalls are a further source of worry (though the problem can be fixed with a software update). In China, a huge market, he faces stiff competition. Meta, by contrast, credits Chinese advertisers with helping drive a big surge in ad revenues last year. </p>

然后是男性对顾客的态度，这一点也同样朝着相反的方向发展。扎克伯格因为Facebook在用户数据、内容管理以及隐私方面采取的快速且宽松的做法而受到谴责。这些问题至今仍然存在，特别是当涉及到社交媒体上的青少年时。

然而，现在Facebook有了一个独立的监督委员会来裁决内容决策，并且Meta表示自2016年以来，它已经在在线安全上投资了200亿美元。

无疑，马斯克仍然有一些忠诚的顾客。但是考虑到有多少美国电动汽车车主倾向于民主党，他在X方面的言论越多，就越明显看出他鄙视他们的政治观点。

最新的召回是一个额外令人担忧的因素（尽管问题可以通过软件更新来解决）。在中国这个巨大的市场中，他面临着严峻的竞争压力。相比之下，Meta将中国广告商归功于帮助推动去年广告收入大幅增长的重要因素。


<h2>Caged tyrant </h2><p>In a nutshell, as Mr Zuckerberg grows older, he appears to have learned from his mistakes. As Mr Musk grows older, he gets more puerile and distracted. His huffy reaction to the Delaware court’s judgment, threatening to up sticks and move Tesla’s incorporation to Texas, is a case in point. It indicates he wants the company’s shareholders to have even less protection from his capriciousness than usual. If anyone should get into the ring and hammer some sense into him, it is them. <span>■</span></p>

简而言之，随着扎克伯格年纪的增长，他似乎从过去的错误中吸取了教训。而马斯克年岁渐长，他变得更加幼稚和分心。他对特拉华州法院裁决的愤怒反应——威胁要搬离并将特斯拉的注册迁移到得州——就是个例子。这表明他希望公司的股东们在面对他的任性和突发奇想时，能得到比平时更少的保护。如果真有人该站出来对他敲打一些理智，那就是他们了。■
