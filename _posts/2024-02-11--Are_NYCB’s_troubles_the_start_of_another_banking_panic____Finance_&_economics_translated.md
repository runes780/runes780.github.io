<div></div><p><span>A</span> <small>bank publishes</small> lousy earnings or an “update” on its business. Its share price plunges. Its name is splashed on newspaper front pages. The bank’s bosses hold a conference call urging calm. Its share price slides some more. Anyone who has paid attention to America’s banking industry over the past year will recognise these events. They ended in failure for Silicon Valley Bank (<small>svb</small>) in March and First Republic Bank (<small>frb</small>) in April. </p>

当银行发布糟糕的财报，或者业务更新令人担忧时，这样的剧情就会上演。股价瞬间暴跌，银行的名字成为报纸头版的焦点。银行高管召开电话会议，竭力呼吁大家保持冷静。然而股价继续下滑。对于过去一年密切关注美国银行业的人来说，这些情况并不陌生。

硅谷银行(SVB)和First Republic Bank (FRB)在三月和四月分别经历了这样的失败。


<p>At first glance, the same script seems to be playing out. On January 31st New York Community Bancorp (<small>NYCb</small>) of Hicksville, New York, reported a quarterly loss. Its stock promptly dropped by 46%. During a hastily organised conference call to investors on February 7th, Alessandro DiNello, the bank’s hastily appointed executive chairman, attempted to soothe fears. Shares sagged, dropping another 10% when markets opened that morning. </p>

乍一看，剧情似乎在重复。1月31日，总部位于纽约希克维尔的社区银行（NYCb）报告了季度亏损。其股价随即下跌46%。2月7日，在匆忙组织的一场面向投资者的电话会议上，匆匆上任的执行主席亚历山德罗·迪内洛（Alessandro DiNello）试图安抚恐慌的情绪。股价继续下滑，当天早上股市开盘时再次下挫10%。


<div><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p>Yet the surface-level similarities in these stories belie two big differences. The first, and most important, is that <small>nycb</small> does not appear to be on the brink of failure, nor is it easy to see how it will fail in the coming weeks. Indeed, its shares later rallied on February 7th. The second is that its problems indicate a different type of trouble has begun. When interest rates rise their impact on things like bond prices is immediate. Their impact on borrowers’ ability to repay debts takes longer to play out. <small>svb</small> and <small>frB </small>were both imperilled by a combination of flighty deposits and their investments in low-interest-rate securities or loans, the value of which collapsed when rates climbed. <small>nycb</small> is struggling, in large part, because a big loan went bad. </p>

然而，这些故事表面上的相似之处掩盖了两个重大差异。第一个，也是最重要的一个，是纽约联合银行（nycb）似乎并未濒临破产边缘，也难以预见在未来几周它将如何失败。事实上，其股票在2月7日后续反弹。第二个区别在于，它的问题揭示了一种不同类型的问题已经开始出现。当利率上升时，它们对债券价格等事物的影响立竿见影。而它们对借款人偿还债务能力的影响则需要更长的时间才能显现出来。

svbandfrB都曾因为存款不稳定和投资低息证券或贷款（这些资产在利率上涨时价值崩溃）的双重威胁而陷入危机。纽约联合银行面临的困境，很大程度上是因为一笔大额贷款出了问题。


<p>Start with <small>nycb</small>’s balance-sheet. The bank, which holds $116bn in assets, earned around $200m in the third quarter of 2023. But in the final quarter it had to set aside $552m to cover property loans, resulting in a $252m loss. Even before this, it was working to beef up capital levels. In 2023 it acquired assets and deposits from Signature Bank, which failed along with <small>SVB</small> last March. This pushed <small>NYCb</small>’s assets past $100bn, subjecting it to stricter regulation. Compared with its new 12-figure peers, <small>NYCb</small> is no fortress. The bank’s common equity tier-1 ratio, a measure of capital based on the riskiness of its assets, fell to an unimpressive 9.1%, down from 9.6% in September. In a bid to retain more equity, the bank slashed its dividend.</p>

从纽约市商业银行（NYCB）的资产负债表开始。这家银行持有总计1160亿美元的资产，在2023年第三季度，它大约赚了20亿美元。然而到了最后一个季度，为了覆盖房地产贷款，它不得不预留55.2亿美元，导致亏损达到了25.2亿美元。

甚至在此之前，该银行已经开始努力增加资本水平。在2023年，它收购了Signature银行的资产和存款，这家银行因为与硅谷银行一起失败，在2023年3月爆发。这使得纽约市商业银行的总资产超过了1万亿美元，使其受到更严格的监管。

与新加入的12位数同行相比，纽约市商业银行并不是一座坚不可摧的城堡。该银行的普通股一级资本比率（衡量基于资产风险性的资本水平）已经下降到了不足引人注目的9.1%，相比9月份的9.6%有所下滑。为了保留更多的股权，该银行削减了分红。


<p>More than half of the bank’s value has now evaporated, leaving it with a market capitalisation of $3bn, less than a third of the book value of its equity. Analysts have slashed their profit forecasts for the bank. On February 6th Moody’s, a rating agency, downgraded <small>NYCB</small> to junk status, citing the bank’s exposure to commercial property and the recent exit of important audit and risk-management personnel.</p>

该银行的价值现已缩水超过一半，市值降至30亿美元，仅为其股权账面价值的三分之一不到。分析师大幅削减了对该银行的利润预测。

2月6日，评级机构穆迪(Moody's)将纽约合作银行(NYCB)的评级下调至垃圾级，理由是该银行对商业房地产的敞口以及近期重要审计和风险管理人员离职的影响。


<div><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p>Grim stuff. But <small>NYCB</small>’s deposits provide reassurance. More than two-thirds of the $83bn deposited at the bank is insured, a much larger share than at <small>SVB </small>and <small>FRB </small>before their collapses, which should mean depositors are less inclined to run. If they do, the bank should be able to weather it. Against an uninsured deposit base of $23bn, <small>nycb </small>holds $17bn in cash, $6bn in securities and collateral that could be used to borrow $14bn from the Federal Home Loan Banks (<small>FHLB</small>) system or the Federal Reserve’s discount window. In addition, it can exchange $10bn of “reciprocal deposits” with other banks, which could in effect reduce the share of <small>nycb</small>‘s deposits that are uninsured.</p>

这些情况看起来不太妙。但纽约市立银行（NYCB）的存款提供了一些安慰。该银行830亿美元的存款中，有超过三分之二即约597亿美元得到了保险保障，这个比例远大于 SVB 和 FRB 在倒闭之前的存款保险覆盖比例。这意味着存款人不太可能蜂拥而逃。如果真的出现这种情况，银行应该能够挺过去。

面对230亿美元无保险存款的基础，纽约市立银行持有170亿美元的现金、60亿美元的证券和可以用来向联邦住房贷款银行系统（FHLB）或联邦储备银行贴现窗口借款140亿美元的抵押品。此外，它还可以与其他银行交换100亿美元的“互惠存款”，这实际上可以在一定程度上减少纽约市立银行无保险存款的比例。


<p>As a result, the bank has access to almost three times as much cash as it needs to pay out all uninsured depositors. And, for now at least, depositors do not appear to be going anywhere. Deposit levels have risen since the end of 2023, according to an unaudited balance-sheet the bank published on February 6th. “We have seen virtually no deposit outflow from our retail branches,” Mr DiNello told investors on February 7th. </p>

因此，这家银行可以近乎拥有三倍于其所需支付所有未保险存款数额的现金。至少目前，存款人似乎并未离开。根据银行2月6日发布的未经审计资产负债表显示，自2023年底以来，存款水平有所上升。“我们几乎没看到零售网点的存款流出。”迪内洛先生在2月7日对投资者表示。


<p>Despite this, <small>NYCB</small>’s troubles might provoke broader unease. One reason for this is its reliance on the <small>FHLB</small> system. This inconspicuous part of America’s financial plumbing comprises 11 government-sponsored banks, with total assets of $1.3trn. America’s lender of “second-to-last resort” raises money from capital markets, and does so cheaply owing to the assumption that the government would backstop its borrowing. It then lends to <small>FHLB</small> members, which are also its dividend-receiving owners. By the end of March 2023 <small>FHLB</small> advances, a type of loan usually secured against mortgages, had nearly tripled since the year before. <small>SVB</small> alone had increased its borrowing to $15bn by the end of 2022. </p>

尽管如此，纽约合作银行的问题可能会引发更广泛的不安。其中一个原因是它对FHLB系统的依赖。这个美国金融基础设施中不起眼的部分，由11家政府支持的银行组成，总资产达到13万亿美元。作为“最后求助者”的贷款人，FHLB从资本市场筹集资金，并因其假设政府将为其借款提供后盾而成本低廉。然后它向FHLB成员放款，这些成员同时也是其分红收益的所有者。截至2023年3月底，FHLB的贷款（通常由抵押贷款担保的一种贷款类型）几乎翻了三倍，相比前一年。SVB仅在2022年底就增加了150亿美元的借款。


<p>Because the <small>nycb</small> holds more loans than deposits it has long relied on <small>FHLB</small> advances as a source of funding, especially before its recent purchases brought in more depositors. At the end of 2023, <small>NYCB</small> had borrowed $20bn of <small>FHLB</small> advances. This borrowing amounts to 17% of <small>NYCB</small>’s assets, up from 12% at the end of September. The bank taps the <small>FHLB</small> system at nine times the rate of similar peers. </p>

因为在大多数时间里，纽约城市银行（NYCB）持有的贷款多于存款，它长期以来一直依赖联邦住房贷款银行（FHLB）的借款作为资金来源。特别是在最近的大额购买为银行带来了更多的存款者之前。

截至2023年底，纽约城市银行从FHLB系统借入了200亿美元。这些借款相当于纽约城市银行总资产的17%，相比之下，截至9月底这一比例为12%。

与类似的同行相比，该行会以九倍的速度从FHLB系统获取资金。


<p>Another reason for broader unease is that this could be the first sign that a crisis in commercial property is now harming the banking system. Although total lending to office buildings is small as a share of loan books across small banks—at around 5% of total assets—the slump in office-building values has been steep. </p>

更广泛的不安的另一个原因可能是，这可能是商业地产危机开始损害银行系统的第一信号。尽管小型银行贷款组合中，对办公大楼的总放款比例很小，大约占总资产的5%左右，但办公楼价值的下滑幅度却非常陡峭。


<p>Other losses are already appearing. Aozora, a Japanese lender that tried out American commercial-property lending, reported losses related to its loans on January 31st. On February 7th Deutsche Pfandbriefbank, a German bank, announced it had increased loss provisions for its commercial-property loans. Given the post-pandemic fall in office use, more losses are likely. These are unlikely to imperil the broader banking system—but they might keep individual banks on the front pages. <span>■</span></p>

其他损失已经开始显现。1月31日，日本贷款机构Aozora（曾尝试美国商业房地产贷款）报告称，其贷款相关的亏损有所增加。2月7日，德国银行Deutsche Pfandbriefbank宣布，已为其商业物业贷款增加了更多的拨备损失。

考虑到疫情后办公空间使用的下降，预计会有更多的损失出现。这些亏损不太可能危及整个银行业系统——但它们可能会让个别银行成为新闻的焦点。■
