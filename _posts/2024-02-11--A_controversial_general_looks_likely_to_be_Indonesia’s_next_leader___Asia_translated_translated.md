<div></div><p><span>A</span><small>t first blush</small>, it did not seem too alarming. At Asia’s leading security conference last year, held in a glitzy ballroom at the Shangri-La hotel in Singapore, Indonesia’s defence minister, Prabowo Subianto, proposed a peace plan for Ukraine. Clad in a western suit and traditional <i>peci</i> cap, he then argued for an immediate ceasefire to establish a demilitarised buffer zone. Both Russia and Ukraine would withdraw 15km from their forward positions. The United Nations would send peacekeepers and organise a referendum to decide which country owned the disputed territory. China, a big investor in Indonesia in recent years, lauded Mr Prabowo’s vision. Ukraine’s defence minister labelled it “a Russian plan” and “strange”. </p>

乍看之下，这并不显得特别令人担忧。去年在新加坡香格里拉酒店那间豪华舞厅召开的亚洲顶级安全会议上，印尼国防部长普拉博沃·苏巴托（Prabowo Subianto）提出了一项乌克兰和平计划。他身着西式西装和传统peci头巾，然后主张立即实行停火，以便建立一个无军事化的缓冲区。俄罗斯和乌克兰都将从其前沿位置后撤15公里。联合国将派遣维和人员，并组织全民公投来决定争议领土归属何国。近年来中国在印尼投资大幅增加，中国对普拉博沃的设想表示赞赏。而乌克兰国防部长则将其称为“俄罗斯计划”并表示“这很奇怪”。

It was that it contradicted the official policy of Indonesia, which had voted to denounce Russia’s invasion of Ukraine at the <small>UN.</small> Mr Prabowo, who is the favourite to win a presidential election on February 14th, had consulted neither the current president, Joko Widodo (“Jokowi”), nor Indonesia’s foreign ministry. For some Asia strategists, his outburst was a promise of volatile new leadership in the world’s fourth-most populous country.</p>

普拉沃诺先生演讲中最奇怪的部分，并不是它似乎是在即兴支持弗拉基米尔·普京。真正令人意外的是，它与印度尼西亚的官方政策相悖，印尼曾投票在联合国谴责俄罗斯入侵乌克兰的行为。普拉沃诺先生是2月14日即将举行的总统选举的热门人选，但他既没有咨询当前总统乔科·维多多（“佐科”），也没有联系印尼外交部。对于一些亚洲战略家来说，他的突然爆发预示着这个全球第四人口大国将出现动荡的新领导层。


<aside><p><i>For more on the Indonesian election, see our <a href="https://www.economist.com/interactive/2024-indonesia-election-tracker">poll tracker</a></i></p></aside><p>The former general’s record is troubling. A former son-in-law of Suharto, a dictator toppled in 1998, Mr Prabowo stands accused of committing atrocities during his decades in the army—including, at the helm of its special forces, in Indonesia’s former territory of East Timor. He is also alleged to have ordered the kidnapping of more than 20 pro-democracy activists in 1998, of whom 13 remain missing. (He denies any wrongdoing.) He was at one time barred from entering America and Australia because of these allegations.</p>

这位前将军的记录令人不安。苏哈托，一个在1998年被推翻的独裁者，其前女婿普拉沃诺被指控在其数十年的军旅生涯中犯下暴行——包括在印度尼西亚特种部队担任领导期间，在该国以前的领土东帝汶犯下的罪行。他还被指控下令于1998年绑架了20多名支持民主人士，其中13人仍然失踪。（他否认有任何不当行为。）由于这些指控，他曾一度被禁止进入美国和澳大利亚。


<div><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p>After losing the past two presidential elections to Jokowi, Mr Prabowo falsely claimed that the vote had been stolen. In 2019 eight people were killed after he urged his supporters to protest against the election result. He has also tried to abolish the direct election of regional leaders and has said Indonesia needs an authoritarian leader. This raises a more worrying question about Indonesia’s future under a probable Prabowo presidency. Will the world’s third-largest democracy continue the broadly successful rise of the post-Suharto period, or return to authoritarianism?</p>

在连续两届总统选举中输给佐科维（Jokowi），普拉伯沃先生（Mr Prabowo）错误地声称选举被窃取。2019年，他呼吁支持者抗议选举结果后，有八人丧生。他还试图废除对地区领导人的直接选举，并表示印尼需要一个专制的领导者。这引出了一个更令人担忧的问题：在普拉伯沃可能成为总统的情况下，印度尼西亚的未来将会怎样？这个世界上第三大民主国家会继续上世纪苏哈托政权结束后成功崛起的趋势，还是会回归到专制主义？


<p>Mr Prabowo owes his strong footing in the race to support from Jokowi, who is extremely popular. The president’s eldest son, Gibran Rakabuming, is Mr Prabowo’s running-mate. There are rumours of a deal between Mr Prabowo and Jokowi that would allow the outgoing president to wield influence behind the scenes after his term ends in October. Jokowi’s popularity is based in part on his <a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2024/02/08/the-false-promise-of-indonesias-economy">solid economic record</a>. During a decade in power he has presided over annual growth of 5%, liberalising reforms and a policy of resource nationalism that has helped develop a nickel-mining industry responsible for nearly half of global output. At the same time, he has weakened Indonesia’s nascent democratic institutions.</p>

在争取印尼民众广泛支持的竞选中，普拉布沃先生的坚实地位部分归功于佐科总统及其广泛的民众基础。佐科总统是印尼最受欢迎的政治领袖之一。

佐科总统的大儿子吉万·拉卡布尤姆（Gibran Rakabuming）是普拉布沃先生竞选中的搭档。两人之间的合作和政治联盟对于两位候选人的选民动员至关重要。

关于普拉布沃先生与佐科总统之间可能存在的交易或协议的传言，这涉及到卸任总统在十月任期结束后继续保持幕后影响力的问题。

佐科总统在位期间，其政治基础部分建立在他的坚实经济成就之上。他掌权十年间，印尼实现了年均5%的增长率，推行了自由化改革，并采取了资源民族主义政策，推动了镍矿开采行业的发展，全球近一半的产量都来自印尼。

然而，在经济发展的同时，佐科总统削弱了印尼正在发展的民主制度的基础。这些因素综合起来，对普拉布沃先生和佐科总统在竞选中的策略和期望产生了深刻影响。


<div><figure><span><img alt="" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/515/90/media-assets/image/20240210_ASM973.png"/></span></figure><p>Last October the country’s constitutional court, whose chief justice is Jokowi’s brother-in-law, delivered a ruling that in effect made the president’s 36-year-old son an exception to a rule that bars anyone under the age of 40 from running for president or vice-president. Jokowi is also alleged to have suborned the once independent anti-corruption commission. He now faces mounting criticism that he is interfering in the election. Rival campaign teams accuse state agencies of arbitrarily cancelling their rallies and intimidating Jokowi’s critics. Prominent Indonesian academics say the president is showing disregard for democracy. </p><p>If no candidate secures over 50% of the vote on February 14th, the election will go to a run-off in late June. That would allow the anti-Prabowo vote to unite, reducing the general’s chance of victory. Mr Prabowo’s two main opponents, Anies Baswedan, a former education minister and governor of Jakarta, and Ganjar Pranowo, a former governor of Central Java province, are both better qualified and more competent than he is. But their lacklustre campaigns have failed to convince many that a Prabowo presidency would be dangerous. According to<i> The Economist’</i>s aggregate of recent opinion polls, Mr Prabowo currently has around 53% of the vote. Mr Anies, who was sacked from Jokowi’s cabinet, has 20% and Mr Ganjar, the candidate of Indonesia’s largest political party, 19%. </p></div><h2>TikTok politics</h2><p>Indonesian elections tend to be decided by personality, not policy. Sure enough, Mr Prabowo’s team has revamped his image by posting short videos of the former general dancing goofily on TikTok, which has more subscribers in Indonesia than any country except America. Such gimmicks have helped divert younger voters, who mostly favour Mr Prabowo, from his unsavoury past. Many consider his military record a plus. Indonesia’s army is its most trusted public institution, surveys suggest.</p>

印尼的选举往往由个性而非政策决定。不出所料，普拉博沃先生的团队通过在印尼订阅用户数超过任何国家（除美国外）的TikTok上发布前将军滑稽舞蹈的短视频，重塑了他的形象。这些噱头有助于吸引年轻选民，他们大多数支持普拉博沃先生，而远离他不光彩的过去。许多人认为他的军旅生涯是一个加分项。调查显示，在印尼，军队是最受信任的公共机构。


<div><figure><span><img alt="" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/701/90/media-assets/image/20240210_ASC304.png"/></span></figure><p>It is unclear what Mr Prabowo would do with the power he has long sought. He has pledged to maintain Jokowi’s measures, including a nickel-centred industrial policy and a plan to relocate the capital from Jakarta to a site in the jungles of Borneo. But given his explosive temper and erratic behaviour, there is little reason to think Mr Prabowo would defer to Jokowi if elected. His other big ideas are mostly impractical or ruinously expensive. </p><p>Mr Prabowo has said double-digit growth is possible. His team says it aims to deliver 6-7% annual growth, in order to prevent Indonesia falling into the middle-income trap. Yet its economy has not grown at 7% since 1996, before the Asian financial crisis. And Mr Prabowo has given few details on how he would make it grow faster. His stump speeches are packed with fiery nationalism. “Some would have us sell raw materials to foreigners at cheap prices. I say: all our wealth must undergo domestic downstream processing!” he recently declared, referring to a policy that forces foreign commodity firms to add value to their products in Indonesia.</p><p>Mr Prabowo also says he wants to lessen Indonesia’s reliance on imported food. As defence minister, he has overseen the destruction of thousands of acres of forest in a failed attempt to boost rice production. He says he will give free milk and lunch to all Indonesian schoolchildren to curb the malnourishment that affects one in five. This programme will cost around $83m a day, estimates a spokesman for Mr Prabowo, Burhanuddin Abdullah, a former governor of Indonesia’s central bank. Mr Prabowo’s rivals argue that policies to reduce stunting should instead be aimed at pregnant mothers and newborn babies, not school-age children. No candidate has said anything of significance on foreign policy, beyond attempting to woo the 9m Indonesian voters who work overseas, many of them as maids, nannies and labourers on building sites.</p><p>The election has had a couple of positives. Five televised candidate debates were each watched by around 100m people. The vote count is expected to be credible. And across the world’s biggest archipelago, voters appear to cherish their suffrage. On a recent day on the campaign trail, tens of thousands travelled, sometimes for hours, on foot, by motorbike or by lorry to catch a glimpse of Mr Anies canvassing support on the island of Madura in east Java. He has held over 20 open forums across Indonesia, known as <i>Desak Anies</i> or “Challenge Anies”, in which voters are invited to fire impromptu questions at him.</p></div><p>Villagers in northern Sumatra questioned Mr Anies about land rights. Younger Indonesians wanted to know if he would legalise marijuana. This kind of campaigning is a break from the past, where politicians would pay dancers and musicians to entertain voters at rallies. It is also “a better way to compete”, says Mr Anies. It is rather hard to imagine this vision of a more serious Indonesian democracy being realised under Mr Prabowo. <span>■</span></p>

北苏门答腊的村民们向安尼亚斯先生询问土地权益问题。年轻的印尼人想知道他是否会合法化大麻。这种形式的政治活动打破了过去的做法，那时政治家们会付钱给舞者和音乐家，在集会上娱乐选民。这也是“一种更好的竞争方式”，正如安尼亚斯先生所说。很难想象在普拉博沃先生领导下，这样一个对印尼民主更加严肃的愿景能够实现。■
