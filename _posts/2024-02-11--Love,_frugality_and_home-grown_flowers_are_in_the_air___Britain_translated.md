# Love, frugality and home-grown flowers are in the air | Britain

But it also makes allowances for changing consumer behaviour. The covid-19 pandemic, the cost-of-living squeeze and even Brexit have changed the way that Britons approach Valentine’s Day, the annual celebration of romance/opportunity to have a blazing row with your partner. </p><p>Loved-up Britons are more likely to stay in on February 14th than they were a few years ago because of tighter budgets and hybrid lifestyles. On average consumers now spend 66 more minutes at home every day compared with the pre-lockdown era. On Valentine’s Day last year just over 8m people used London’s buses and tube network, around 22% fewer than did so on the same day in 2020. Spending at restaurants fell by 11.6% in January year on year. </p><div><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p>Those couples who decide to eat in on Valentine’s Day this year have more options than they did before covid. Some restaurants now offer their own <small>DIY</small> meal kits, delivering the ingredients and recipes for chef-crafted meals directly to diners’ homes. A wealth of pandemic-born businesses have ditched bricks and mortar altogether. YHangry, an online platform, allows users to hire private chefs to provide a restaurant-style meal at home. </p><p>Singletons can be homebodies, too. The period between Christmas and Valentine’s Day is peak season for dating apps: matches between Tinder users globally were 10% higher than normal in the run-up to February 14th last year. But some of these matches opt for virtual dates. Around 6% of those polled in Britain will meet with a romantic prospect online this Valentine’s Day, slightly more than in Europe, a survey by GlobalWebIndex, a research firm, shows. </p><p>Frugality will affect gift choices. Around 43% of Britons are currently tightening their belts, according to a survey by Barclays, a British bank. Half of those planning to buy flowers on February 14th are intending to skip the florist and pick them up at the supermarket instead. </p><p>The blooms they buy are changing. Brexit-related border checks that kicked in on January 31st make importing flowers a more arduous process this year, and when demand is so time-sensitive, any delay can be disastrous. Some florists were already turning away from red roses and opting for homegrown flowers such as snowdrops or tulips instead. “Valentine’s Day creates a huge and unnecessary spike in demand for red roses which rapidly unwinds the following day, risking high levels of waste,” says Aron Gelbard, <small>CEO</small> and founder of Bloom and Wild, an online flower-delivery service. “We stopped selling them in 2021.” <span>■</span></p>
