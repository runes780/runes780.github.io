<div></div><p><span>I</span><small>t was more</small> like something from a spy thriller than a seminal political meeting. On the night of January 29th Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, the leader of Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party (<small>DUP</small>), planned to persuade his party to return to the province’s devolved government. He had sent the media to another location. Even the 130 members of the party’s ruling executive weren’t told where they were going until a few hours beforehand.</p>

更像是一部间谍惊悚片中的情节，而非一场具有里程碑意义的政治会议。1月29日的夜晚，北爱尔兰民主统一党（DUP）领袖杰弗里·唐纳森爵士（Sir Jeffrey Donaldson）精心策划了一个行动，他打算说服自己的政党重返该省分化的政府机构。他已经把媒体引到了另一个地点。就连党统治执行机构的130名成员，直到几个小时之前才被告知他们要去哪里。

Among those present in a room at the Larchfield Estate outside Lisburn, a city south-west of Belfast, was at least one person wearing a wire. As Sir Jeffrey spoke, his words were being broadcast live to Jamie Bryson, an activist who live-tweeted the juiciest morsels. Pandemonium ensued as the party tried to plug the leak. Members were ordered to turn off their phones; accusations were levelled at police bodyguards. </p>

他本不必费心。在Lisburn市郊外的拉奇菲尔德庄园（Larchfield Estate）的一个房间里，至少有一个人戴着窃听设备。当爵士杰弗里发言时，他的言论被实时广播给杰米·布瑞森（Jamie Bryson）。布瑞森是一名活跃份子，他会在推特上直播那些最劲爆的片段。随后是一片混乱，派对成员试图堵住信息泄露的源头。他们被命令关闭手机；指责警察保镖的行为也在流传。


<p>Despite the chaos, the meeting eventually settled on a decision to restore Northern Ireland’s devolved government after a two-year absence. The power-sharing government had collapsed when the <small>DUP</small>, the largest unionist (pro-British) party, walked out. The <small>DUP</small> had been losing support among its base because Britain’s Brexit deal with the <small>EU</small> had established a customs and regulatory border in the Irish Sea. That ensured the Irish land border remained open and protected the <small>EU</small>’s single market, but at the cost of erecting barriers between Britain and Northern Ireland. </p>

尽管局势混乱，会议最终还是在缺席两年后，决定恢复北爱尔兰的地方分权政府。当最大的统一派（亲英）政党民主统一党（DUP）退出时，权力共享政府就崩溃了。长期以来，由于英国与欧盟之间的脱欧协议，在爱尔兰海设立了海关和监管边界，导致DUP在其基础选民中的支持度下降。这个协议确保了爱尔兰陆地边境仍然开放，并保护了欧盟单一市场，但代价是在英国和北爱尔兰之间竖起屏障。


<div><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p>Some of these barriers were lowered by the Windsor Framework, a <a href="https://www.economist.com/britain/2023/10/26/is-the-windsor-framework-in-northern-ireland-working">deal</a> reached by the <small>EU</small> and Rishi Sunak in 2023. As the price of re-entering government Sir Jeffrey has secured a raft of other measures designed to reassure unionists that they remain British. The “green lane” established by the Windsor Framework for British retail goods entering Northern Ireland and staying there will be called the “<small>UK</small> Internal Market Lane”; there will be no routine checks on such items. A new law will commit to never putting up barriers to Northern Irish produce entering Britain. Such measures give Sir Jeffrey something to trumpet, but in neither Westminster nor Belfast do they heal the fissures of Brexit.</p>

其中一些障碍在温莎框架下得到了降低，这是一个由欧盟和里希·苏纳克于2023年达成的协议。为了重新进入政府付出的代价，杰弗里爵士已经确保了多项其他措施，旨在让联合主义者安心，他们仍然是英国的一部分。

温莎框架为进入北爱尔兰并在那里停留的英国零售商品设立的“绿色车道”将被称为“UK内部市场车道”；此类商品不会有常规检查。一项新法律将承诺永远不会设置障碍阻止北爱尔兰农产品进入英国。这样的举措给了杰弗里爵士可以吹嘘的东西，但在威斯敏斯特或贝尔法斯特，它们都无法弥合 Brexit 带来的裂痕。


<p>One element of the deal is a requirement for government ministers in London to attach a statement to every new law clarifying whether it will harden the Irish Sea border. Brexiteers fear that could give some ministers the cover they desire to slow divergence from <small>EU</small> standards. If that happens, tiny Northern Ireland, with less than 3% of the British population, might be seen as a brake on what to many Leavers was the whole point of the enterprise—breaking free from Brussels. Far from reinforcing the union, that could strain it. </p>

该协议的一个方面是要求伦敦的政府部长在制定每一条新法律时，都需要附上一份声明，明确说明这条法律是否会强化爱尔兰海边境的壁垒。英国脱欧派担心这可能会给一些部长提供他们所渴望的减缓与欧盟标准分歧的速度的理由。如果这种情况发生，只有不到3%英国人口的北爱尔兰这样一个小地方，可能会被视为阻碍对许多脱离者来说是整个事业核心的东西——即摆脱布鲁塞尔束缚的努力——刹车。远非强化联盟，这反而可能给联盟带来压力。


<p>The faultlines within unionism in Northern Ireland have not disappeared either. By causing the collapse of the province’s government in 2022, Sir Jeffrey aligned himself with the most extreme elements of unionism. He promised them that he would return to Stormont only if he had got rid of the sea border. </p>

北爱尔兰工会主义内部的分歧也同样没有消失。2022年，爵士杰弗里通过引发该省政府的垮台，把自己与最激进的工会主义分子站在一起。他向他们保证，除非他已经解决了沿海边界的问题，否则他不会回到斯特蒙特。

全文翻译结束。


<p>This was a pledge he could not fulfil; <a href="https://www.economist.com/britain/2023/10/26/is-the-windsor-framework-in-northern-ireland-working">the <small>EU</small> would not allow it</a>. That<!-- --> opens Sir Jeffrey to accusations of betrayal from hardliners such as Mr Bryson, a provocateur who wants to undo the Good Friday Agreement, the deal struck in 1998 to end 30 years of sectarian strife, and who has contacts with loyalist paramilitaries who retain guns and thousands of members. (He denies being a member of any such groups.) Mr Bryson wields more influence than many politicians because of his social-media following and headline-grabbing stunts. His views of the deal are shared by many within the <small>DUP</small>; more than 40% of Sir Jeffrey’s party officers oppose it. </p>

这段话意味着一个他无法实现的承诺；欧盟不会允许这样做的。这给杰弗里爵士带来了被强硬派人士如布赖森先生指控背叛的风险，布赖森先生是一个挑衅者，他希望推翻1998年达成的《贝尔法斯特协议》（Good Friday Agreement）。这份协议结束了30年的宗派冲突，并且与忠诚主义准军事人员保持着联系，这些人仍有枪支和数千名成员。（他否认自己是任何此类团体的成员。）布赖森先生的影响力超过了许多政治家，这主要是因为他在社交媒体上的粉丝以及吸引眼球的行为。他对协议的看法在北爱尔兰统一党（DUP）内部有许多人支持；超过40%的杰弗里爵士所在政党的官员反对该协议。


<div><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p>Even when the <small>DUP</small> was far more united, devolved government in Northern Ireland, a system in which diametrically opposing parties have to share power, has rarely been stable. This time, moreover, staunch unionists have to swallow the fact that elections (which took place in 2022, three months after the government collapsed) have changed the political landscape. The first minister, Michelle O’Neill, will be from <a href="https://www.economist.com/britain/sinn-fein-has-become-northern-irelands-biggest-party/21809215">Sinn Féin</a>, a nationalist party that was once the political wing of the <small>IRA</small>, the dominant terrorist group in the region. For the first time in the 103-year history of Northern Ireland, the province will be led by someone who doesn’t even want Northern Ireland to exist. </p>

即使在民主统一党（DUP）内部更加团结的时候，北爱尔兰的分权政府也极少是稳定的。此外，这次坚定的联合主义者不得不接受这样的事实：选举（2022年举行，政府垮台三个月后）改变了政治格局。首席部长米歇尔·奥尼尔将来自民族主义政党 Sinn Féin，该党曾经是爱尔兰共和军（IRA）的政治翼，IRA在该地区曾是最主要的恐怖组织。北爱尔兰103年的历史上首次，该省将由一位甚至不希望北爱尔兰存在的人领导。


<p>Sinn Féin’s moment of triumph does not mean a united Ireland is imminent. Even after the chaos of the post-Brexit period and two years in which public services have been degraded by the absence of devolved government, support for Irish unity has only risen modestly. But each time the government collapses, it chips away at the hope that Northern Ireland would flourish once the killings of <a href="https://www.economist.com/britain/2024/01/18/northern-irelands-peace-process-is-not-over">the Troubles</a> stopped. The <small>DUP</small>’s decision to return to the Northern Ireland Assembly in Stormont is good news. But plenty in the province think that this is the last chance for devolution to show that it can work. <span>■</span></p>

 Sinn Féin的辉煌时刻并不意味着一个统一的爱尔兰即将来临。即使在脱欧后的混乱时期以及公共服务因地方政府权力受限而被削弱的两年后，支持爱尔兰统一的声音也只是适度上升。但是每次政府垮台，都会侵蚀北爱尔兰人民对未来和平繁荣的希望。 DUP决定重返位于斯特林姆的北爱尔兰议会是好消息。然而，该省许多人认为这可能是地方分权制度最后一次证明其可行性的机会了。■
