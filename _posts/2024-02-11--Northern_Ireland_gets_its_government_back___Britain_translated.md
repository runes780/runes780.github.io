<div></div><p><span>I</span><small>t was more</small> like something from a spy thriller than a seminal political meeting. On the night of January 29th Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, the leader of Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party (<small>DUP</small>), planned to persuade his party to return to the province’s devolved government. He had sent the media to another location. Even the 130 members of the party’s ruling executive weren’t told where they were going until a few hours beforehand.</p>

更像间谍惊悚片中的情节，而非一场开创性政治会议。1月29日晚，北爱尔兰民主统一党（DUP）领袖杰弗里·唐纳森爵士(Sir Jeffrey Donaldson)计划说服他的政党重返该省自治政府。他把媒体送到了其他地方。就连党内统治执行机构的130名成员，在几小时前才被告知他们的目的地。

Among those present in a room at the Larchfield Estate outside Lisburn, a city south-west of Belfast, was at least one person wearing a wire. As Sir Jeffrey spoke, his words were being broadcast live to Jamie Bryson, an activist who live-tweeted the juiciest morsels. Pandemonium ensued as the party tried to plug the leak. Members were ordered to turn off their phones; accusations were levelled at police bodyguards. </p>

他本不必费心。在距离贝尔法斯特西南约20公里的利斯堡郊外，拉尔夫菲尔德庄园的一间屋子里，至少有一位身着监听设备的人。当爵士杰弗里讲话时，他的言语正被实时直播到活跃分子杰米布莱森的推特上。其间一片混乱，随着聚会试图堵住漏洞，成员们被命令关闭手机；对警方保镖的指责也开始出现。


<p>Despite the chaos, the meeting eventually settled on a decision to restore Northern Ireland’s devolved government after a two-year absence. The power-sharing government had collapsed when the <small>DUP</small>, the largest unionist (pro-British) party, walked out. The <small>DUP</small> had been losing support among its base because Britain’s Brexit deal with the <small>EU</small> had established a customs and regulatory border in the Irish Sea. That ensured the Irish land border remained open and protected the <small>EU</small>’s single market, but at the cost of erecting barriers between Britain and Northern Ireland. </p>

尽管局势混乱，会议最终还是就一项决定达成一致，即在缺席两年后恢复北爱尔兰的分权政府。当最大的统一派（亲英）政党民主统一党（DUP）退出时，权力分享政府崩溃了。由于英国与欧盟达成的 Brexit 贸易协议已经在 Irish Sea 中设立了海关和监管边界，因此DUP在其基础上的支持正在流失。这个协议确保爱尔兰陆地边境保持开放，并保护欧盟单一市场，但代价是在英国和北爱尔兰之间竖起屏障。


<div><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p>Some of these barriers were lowered by the Windsor Framework, a <a href="https://www.economist.com/britain/2023/10/26/is-the-windsor-framework-in-northern-ireland-working">deal</a> reached by the <small>EU</small> and Rishi Sunak in 2023. As the price of re-entering government Sir Jeffrey has secured a raft of other measures designed to reassure unionists that they remain British. The “green lane” established by the Windsor Framework for British retail goods entering Northern Ireland and staying there will be called the “<small>UK</small> Internal Market Lane”; there will be no routine checks on such items. A new law will commit to never putting up barriers to Northern Irish produce entering Britain. Such measures give Sir Jeffrey something to trumpet, but in neither Westminster nor Belfast do they heal the fissures of Brexit.</p>

其中一些障碍在《温莎框架》中被降低，这是一项于2023年由欧盟和里希·苏纳克达成的协议。鉴于重返政府职位的代价，杰弗里爵士已经确保了一系列其他措施，旨在安抚联合主义者，让他们确信自己仍然是英国的一部分。

《温莎框架》为进入北爱尔兰并在当地停留的英国零售商品设立的“绿色通道”将被称为“英国内部市场通道”；这类货物不会进行常规检查。一项新的法律承诺永远不会设置障碍阻止北爱尔兰农产品进入英国。

这些措施让杰弗里爵士有所宣扬，但无论是威斯敏斯特还是贝尔法斯特，它们都无法治愈脱欧带来的裂痕。


<p>One element of the deal is a requirement for government ministers in London to attach a statement to every new law clarifying whether it will harden the Irish Sea border. Brexiteers fear that could give some ministers the cover they desire to slow divergence from <small>EU</small> standards. If that happens, tiny Northern Ireland, with less than 3% of the British population, might be seen as a brake on what to many Leavers was the whole point of the enterprise—breaking free from Brussels. Far from reinforcing the union, that could strain it. </p>

交易协议中的一个条款要求伦敦的政府部长们在每一条新法律旁边附上一份声明，阐明该法律是否会强化爱尔兰海边境。Brexit的支持者担心这可能会为一些部长提供他们所渴望的放慢与欧盟标准分化速度的掩护。如果这种情况发生，人口只有英国约3%的小不列颠北爱尔兰将被视为阻止许多人（即Leavers）认为这场运动的根本目的——从布鲁塞尔解放出来——这一进程的一个刹车。这不仅不会强化联盟，反而可能会使其紧张。


<p>The faultlines within unionism in Northern Ireland have not disappeared either. By causing the collapse of the province’s government in 2022, Sir Jeffrey aligned himself with the most extreme elements of unionism. He promised them that he would return to Stormont only if he had got rid of the sea border. </p>

北爱尔兰工会主义内部的分歧也同样没有消失。2022年，杰弗里爵士通过导致该省政府垮台的行为，站到了最激进的工会主义分支一边。他向他们保证，只有在消除海上边境之后，他才会重返斯特林姆特。

<p>This was a pledge he could not fulfil; <a href="https://www.economist.com/britain/2023/10/26/is-the-windsor-framework-in-northern-ireland-working">the <small>EU</small> would not allow it</a>. That<!-- --> opens Sir Jeffrey to accusations of betrayal from hardliners such as Mr Bryson, a provocateur who wants to undo the Good Friday Agreement, the deal struck in 1998 to end 30 years of sectarian strife, and who has contacts with loyalist paramilitaries who retain guns and thousands of members. (He denies being a member of any such groups.) Mr Bryson wields more influence than many politicians because of his social-media following and headline-grabbing stunts. His views of the deal are shared by many within the <small>DUP</small>; more than 40% of Sir Jeffrey’s party officers oppose it. </p>

这是个他无法履行的承诺；欧盟不会允许这样做。这就给杰弗里爵士招来了来自像布赖森先生这样强硬派的背叛指控，布赖森先生是一个煽动者，他想要推翻1998年达成的《贝尔法斯特协议》。这份协议结束了长达30年的宗派冲突，并且他还与保皇派准军事组织有联系，这些组织仍然拥有枪支和数千名成员。（他否认自己属于任何这类团体。）布赖森先生因其社交媒体追随者和吸引眼球行为而拥有的影响力远超过许多政治家。关于协议的观点在DUP内部被许多人共享；超过40%的杰弗里爵士所在政党的官员反对这份协议。


<div><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p>Even when the <small>DUP</small> was far more united, devolved government in Northern Ireland, a system in which diametrically opposing parties have to share power, has rarely been stable. This time, moreover, staunch unionists have to swallow the fact that elections (which took place in 2022, three months after the government collapsed) have changed the political landscape. The first minister, Michelle O’Neill, will be from <a href="https://www.economist.com/britain/sinn-fein-has-become-northern-irelands-biggest-party/21809215">Sinn Féin</a>, a nationalist party that was once the political wing of the <small>IRA</small>, the dominant terrorist group in the region. For the first time in the 103-year history of Northern Ireland, the province will be led by someone who doesn’t even want Northern Ireland to exist. </p>

即使是在 DUP（民主统一党）内部更为团结的时候，北爱尔兰的地方政府——一个要求对立政党共同执政的体系——很少有过稳定时期。此次，坚定的联合主义者不得不接受这样一个事实：选举（发生在2022年，即政府垮台三个月后）已经改变了政治格局。首席部长米歇尔·奥尼尔来自新芬党（Sinn Féin），这是一个民族主义政党，曾是爱尔兰共和军（IRA）——该地区主导恐怖组织——的政治翼。北爱尔兰103年的历史上首次出现这样的情况：这个省份将由一位甚至不希望北爱尔兰存在的人领导。


<p>Sinn Féin’s moment of triumph does not mean a united Ireland is imminent. Even after the chaos of the post-Brexit period and two years in which public services have been degraded by the absence of devolved government, support for Irish unity has only risen modestly. But each time the government collapses, it chips away at the hope that Northern Ireland would flourish once the killings of <a href="https://www.economist.com/britain/2024/01/18/northern-irelands-peace-process-is-not-over">the Troubles</a> stopped. The <small>DUP</small>’s decision to return to the Northern Ireland Assembly in Stormont is good news. But plenty in the province think that this is the last chance for devolution to show that it can work. <span>■</span></p>

 Sinn Féin（新芬党）的辉煌时刻并不意味着统一的爱尔兰即将来临。即使在英国脱欧后的混乱时期和公共服务因没有地方分权政府而遭到削弱的两年后，支持爱尔兰统一的支持度也只是适度上升。但每次政府垮台，就侵蚀了一点希望——一旦北爱尔兰 Troubles 的暴力活动停止，它将繁荣发展。DUP（民主统一党）决定重返位于斯特林的北爱尔兰议会的好消息。然而，该省很多人认为这是地方分权制度最后一次证明其可行性的机会。■
