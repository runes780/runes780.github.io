<div></div><p><span>A</span><small>s a general </small>practitioner (<small>gp</small>) in a deprived inner-city neighbourhood of Birmingham, Judith Yates had a close-up view of the evolution of Britain’s illegal drugs market. In the 1980s some of her poorest patients became addicted to Afghan heroin as it flooded the market. In the 1990s they made crack pipes from Coca-Cola cans and asthma inhalers. Some recovered. Others went in and out of prison, where they often became addicted to other drugs. Several died.</p>

作为伯明翰一个贫困市中心社区的全科医生（GP），朱迪丝·耶茨近距离见证了英国非法毒品市场的发展变迁。在20世纪80年代，她的一些最贫穷的病人开始沉迷于涌入市场的阿富汗海洛因。到了90年代，他们用可口可乐罐和哮喘吸入剂制作了霹雳管。有些人康复了，而其他人则进进出出监狱，在那里他们常常对其他药物上瘾。其中一些人去世了。

What she found alarmed her. Drug deaths were increasing every year. And opioids were playing a big role.</p>

2010年，叶茨博士对政府在毒品战争中取得的进展感到沮丧，她开始定期访问当地的法医办公室，收集有关药物死亡的信息。“我想寻找模式，看看我们是否可以防止人们死亡。”她说。

她的发现让她震惊。每年，由于药物导致的死亡都在增加。而阿片类药物的作用不容忽视。

叶茨的调查让她大吃一惊。每年，药物导致的死亡人数都在稳步上升。而阿片类药物在这个问题上扮演着关键角色。

她的发现让她非常震惊。每年，药物死亡事件的数量都在逐年增长。阿片类药物在这其中扮演了重要作用。


<div><figure><span><img alt="" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/704/90/media-assets/image/20240210_BRC972.png"/></span></figure><p>In 2022 Dr Yates (by then retired but continuing her investigations) spotted the name of a drug on the coroner’s reports that she had not seen before: n-pyrrolidino etonitazene. This is one of a class of new synthetic opioids known as nitazenes which are at least as powerful as fentanyl (another synthetic opioid that is itself up to 50 times more powerful than heroin) and often many times more so (see chart). </p><p>The drug had been found in three young men who had died, two students and a businessman—quite different sorts of drug users from those Dr Yates was used to seeing in coroners’ reports. They had bought what appeared to be pharmaceutical-grade oxycodone (painkiller) pills online. “They would have thought they were self-medicating to reduce the stresses of life,” she says. “They certainly did not expect to die.” </p><p>Dr Yates’s experience is a microcosm of a wider crisis. Drug deaths in England and Wales have risen every year since 2012. In 2022, the most recent year for which there are data, the figure was 4,907, according to the Office for National Statistics (<small>ons</small>); 89% higher than in 2012. In that period some features of drug deaths have remained steady. Most victims are male (see chart). The north-east has the highest death rate. (Scotland, which is subject to the same laws but where drug deaths are counted separately, has one of the highest rates in Europe.) And the same generation—people born in the 1970s—are the likeliest to die.</p></div><div><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><div><figure><span><img alt="" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/662/90/media-assets/image/20240210_BRC282.png"/></span></figure><p>The vulnerability of this cohort is explained in part because in the last two decades of the 20th century more young people started using hard drugs, chiefly heroin and cocaine. These do more damage to the body as it ages. Deaths caused by cocaine, which has become increasingly popular as it has become cheaper, rose to 857 in 2022 from 112 in 2011. Drug-induced deaths may also be rising because it has become more common to take more than one substance at a time, which is likelier to be fatal. </p><p>But the most worrying part of the picture involves the consumption of synthetic opioids. Britain, like most of Europe, has so far sidestepped the <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/12/23/the-deaths-of-despair-narrative-is-out-of-date">opioid crisis that killed 70,000 Americans</a> last year alone. Because of its nationalised, non-profit-driven health-care system (in which doctors are generally responsible about prescribing opioids), it is unlikely to ever develop a problem as big as America’s.</p><p>Yet experts worry that an opioid crisis may nonetheless be looming because of changes to the global drugs trade. Most heroin in Europe comes from Afghanistan, where in 2021 the Taliban announced a ban on opium, a gum produced from poppies from which heroin is manufactured. Two missed poppy harvests later, the market for synthetic opioids such as nitazenes—which are relatively easy and cheap to manufacture (in China, it is thought) and then post—is said to be booming.</p><p>No one knows how many people in Britain have been killed by nitazenes. They have been detected in several dozen cases but are not always tested for. Meg Jones, director of Cranstoun, a charity, says nitazenes are being cut into many different sorts of drugs, often accidentally (because they are cut and packed on the same surface). In November the Home Office said it was decreeing 15 new drugs to be “class A”, the most dangerous sort. Most of them are nitazene compounds. </p></div><div><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p>Britain is singularly unprepared for an opioid crisis. Funding cuts in the 2010s have devastated drug-treatment programmes. In the second part of an independent, government-commissioned review into drugs published in 2021, Professor Carol Black, a doctor and academic, said that “funding cuts have left treatment and recovery services on their knees.” The workforce was “depleted, especially of professionally qualified people, and demoralised”. “The current situation is intolerable,” she said.</p>

英国对即将到来的阿片类药物危机准备不足。2010年代的资助削减几乎摧毁了药物治疗计划。2021年发布的政府委托、独立的毒品审查报告第二部分中，医生兼学者的卡罗尔·布莱克教授表示：“资金削减使得治疗和康复服务举步维艰。”工作队伍“人手不足，尤其是专业资格人员，士气低落”。她表示：“当前的情况无法容忍。”


<p>The government has acknowledged that more investment in such services is needed. Yet it needs to do a lot more than restore what it has squandered. Since Britain passed the Drugs Misuse Act 1971, which criminalises possession of illicit drugs, it has taken a moralistic, punitive attitude to drug use that has achieved little.</p>

政府已经承认，这些服务领域需要更多的投资。但是，政府需要做的远不止恢复被浪费的部分。自从英国在1971年通过《毒品误用法》，将非法药物的持有定为犯罪以来，英国对毒品使用的道德化、惩罚性态度收效甚微。


<p>Britain remains one of the few countries in Europe that does not have safe drug-consumption rooms (though one is due to <a href="https://www.economist.com/britain/2023/09/21/britain-explores-softening-its-war-on-drugs">open in Scotland</a> soon). That is because to run one could mean being charged with a crime. Research suggests such places do not increase drug use but help users enrol in other treatment. They are, moreover, a low-cost intervention, requiring little more than a room, a health-care worker and a supply of overdose medications. Yet Rishi Sunak, the prime minister, has said they “condone use of drugs”.</p>

英国仍然是欧洲少数几个没有安全药物消费室的国家（尽管苏格兰很快将开设一个）。这是因为在运营这样的场所可能会被指控犯罪。研究表明，这些地方并没有增加吸毒行为，而是帮助用户参加其他治疗。此外，它们还是一种低成本干预，只需要一间房间、一名医疗工作者和过量药物的供应即可。

然而，首相里希·苏纳克却表示，这样的场所“默许了药物使用”。


<p>There has been some progress. Police forces increasingly carry naloxone, an opioid antidote. Once only available in injectable form, it is now available as a nasal spray. Officers prefer using this to giving drug addicts <small>cpr</small>. (Multiple doses may be needed to save someone who has taken nitazenes.) Last month The Loop, a charity, opened the first Home Office-licensed drug-testing site, in Bristol. It will allow users to submit samples of illegal drugs; if there are concerns about the potency and purity of substances, local authorities can send public-health alerts and the buyer can be offered advice and treatment. More such centres are crucial. </p>

已经取得了一些进展。警察部门越来越多地携带纳洛酮（opiate的解毒剂）。以前纳洛酮只以注射形式提供，现在它也可以作为鼻喷雾使用。警官们更倾向于使用这种药，而不是给吸毒者做心肺复苏。（对于服用nitazenes的人，可能需要多次剂量才能挽救生命。）上个月，慈善机构The Loop开设了英格兰布里斯托尔的第一个经内政部许可的药物检测站点。它允许用户提交非法毒品的样本；如果对物质的有效性和纯度有担忧，地方当局可以发送公共卫生警报，并可以为购买者提供咨询和治疗。需要更多这样的中心。


<p>In a rapidly evolving drug market information is power, says Dr Yates. She would, for instance, like the government to find a way to hasten the dissemination of information about drug deaths, which are usually certified by coroners. The <small>ons</small> says that record delays in inquests mean 64% of deaths that were registered in 2022 actually occurred in previous years. If Britain does have an opioid crisis, it may not find out before it is too late. <span>■</span></p>

在快速发展的毒品市场中，信息就是力量，Yates博士如此表示。例如，她希望政府能找到办法加快关于毒品死亡事件的信息传播，这些死亡通常由验尸官确认。Theonssays，调查延误导致64%的2022年登记死亡实际上发生在前几年。如果英国确实存在阿片类药物危机，可能在为时已晚之前还未能发现这一点。■
