<div></div><p><span>A</span><small>fter months</small> of prevarication, the Labour Party has made a dramatic reversal of its plans to decarbonise <a href="https://www.economist.com/britain/2024/02/08/britains-economy-will-need-rate-cuts-sooner-rather-than-later">Britain’s economy</a>. In 2021 the party announced that if it got into power, it would spend £28bn ($35bn; 1.2% of <small>GDP</small>) annually until 2030 to cut emissions and build up green industries; it subsequently adopted the more limited goal of getting to that level of spending after 2027.</p>

经过数月的拖延，工党突然改变了其计划，即碳中和英国经济。2021年，该政党宣布，如果上台执政，他们将每年花费280亿英镑（350亿美元；占GDP的1.2%）直到2030年，以减少排放并建立绿色产业；此后，他们采纳了更有限的目标：在2027年之后达到这样的支出水平。


<p>On February 8th <a href="https://www.economist.com/britain/2024/01/11/keir-starmer-reform-uk-and-britains-populist-paradox">Sir Keir Starmer</a>, the Labour leader, cut that figure to around £4.7bn per year, blaming the Conservative government for a weak economy, elevated borrowing costs and limited fiscal headroom. “We’ve got to adjust to the situation we find ourselves in,” said Sir Keir. “As circumstances change, you have to adjust your decisions.” The political calculation behind this decision is understandable; the policy that results remains a mess. </p>

2月8日，工党领袖基尔·斯泰默爵士(Kir Starmer)将这一数字削减至每年约470亿英镑，指责保守政府导致经济疲软、借贷成本上升以及财政空间有限。“我们必须调整以适应我们所处的形势。”斯泰默爵士说。“随着情况的变化，你必须调整你的决定。”

这个决定背后的政治考量是可以理解的；随之而来的政策仍然是一团糟。

Labour’s poll lead over the Tories is titanic—21 points, according to <i>The Economist</i>’s <a href="https://www.economist.com/interactive/uk-general-election/polls">poll tracker</a>. Yet the party’s reputation for economic management still remains an area of relative weakness: only 29% of voters say Labour would be better on the economy than the Tories compared with 28% who disagree, according to a poll by Ipsos in December.</p>

先来看看政治方面。据《经济学人》的民调追踪，工党对保守党的民意领先优势可谓巨大——达到了21个百分点。然而，在经济管理方面的声誉仍然是工党相对薄弱的一个领域：根据Ipsos去年12月的一项民调，只有29%的选民认为在经济上，工党和保守党相比，工党更好，而持相反观点的人占28%。

<p>The Conservative Party was intent on attacking the £28bn, which was an unfunded spending commitment. A political broadcast by Rishi Sunak, released on February 7th, warned that the policy would result in more borrowing or higher taxes. “Both of those things are going to cost you and your family,” he said, reviving a message that had proven potent in the Tories’ 2015 election campaign. Ditching the commitment means that the risk of Labour’s election campaign being torpedoed on grounds of fiscal irresponsibility has fallen. The change “should be enough to make Labour’s spending plans consistent with their promise to have debt on track to fall as a share of national income,” said Ben Zaranko of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, a think-tank. </p>

保守党政府专注于攻击一项价值280亿英镑的承诺，这是一项未提供资金支持的支出承诺。2月7日发布的Rishi Sunak的政治广播警告说，这项政策将导致更多的借贷或更高的税收。“这两件事都会让你和你的家人付出代价。”他重申了一条在保守党2015年选举活动中证明有效的信息。放弃这一承诺意味着，工党的竞选活动面临财政不负责任理由而导致失败的风险已经降低。智库财政研究所的Ben Zaranko表示：“这一变化‘应该足以使工党的支出计划与他们关于让债务占国内生产总值的比例回到下降轨道的诺言相一致’。”


<p>But by closing down one avenue of attack, Labour has exposed two more. The first is that Sir Keir is an unprincipled flip-flopper. The <small>U</small>-turn has been excruciatingly slow in coming. When Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, unveiled the £28bn number, the yield on ten-year British government bonds was about 1%. As yields rose, the policy was gradually hedged with so many caveats that it became a zombie, privately declared dead by some party figures but officially still in force (and described as “desperately needed” by Sir Keir as recently as February 6th). This dithering reinforces a growing critique of Sir Keir: that his deliberative, consultative approach to decision-making is simply too slow for modern government. </p>

但是，工党通过关闭一个攻击途径，却暴露了两个更多问题。第一个问题是，基尔爵士是一个原则不明、立场摇摆的人。这个U-turn来得极其缓慢和痛苦。当影子财政大臣雷切尔·里夫斯公布这项总额280亿英镑的政策时，英国10年期政府债券的收益率大约为1%。随着收益率上升，该政策逐渐被诸多条件所缓和，最终成为了一具僵尸：在党内的一些人士私下宣布它已死亡，但它在官方层面仍继续存在（基尔爵士直到2月6日还公开称这是“迫切需要的”）。这种犹豫不决强化了对基尔爵士越来越多的批评：他的深思熟虑、咨询式的决策方式对于现代政府来说过于缓慢。


<div><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p>The second avenue of attack is that Labour does not have a vision for government. Junking the policy was met with despair by many in Labour’s ranks who want faster action on climate change and question whether the decision leaves much of an agenda at all. It makes the party more vulnerable to poaching from its left flank, particularly by the Green Party and the Scottish National Party. </p>

第二种攻击方式是，工党没有为政府设定愿景。许多工党内人士对政策的废除感到绝望，他们希望加快应对气候变化的步伐，并质疑这一决定是否还留下了任何实质性议程。这使得该政党更容易受到来自左翼的党派诱惑，特别是绿党和苏格兰民族党。


<p>As for the policy, the end of the £28bn-a-year target is not something to mourn. The pledge was retrospectively cast as a response to the American government’s Inflation Reduction Act, a vast package of green-energy tax breaks, and similar responses in Europe. Yet Labour never properly acknowledged the challenge that Britain faces, as a mid-sized economy with weak public finances, in rivalling America in luring investment. </p>

至于政策，每年280亿英镑目标的终结并不是什么值得哀悼的事情。这一承诺被事后当作是对美国政府《通胀减少法案》的回应，该法案包含大量绿色能源税收优惠，欧洲也采取了类似措施。然而工党从未真正承认英国面临的挑战：作为一个中等规模的经济体，公共财政薄弱，要在吸引投资方面与美国抗衡。


<p>Its size may also have been beyond what was needed. The Climate Change Committee (<small>CCC</small>), which advises the government on the climate transition, estimates that reaching net zero requires total public and private investment in green projects to increase from around £10bn per year in 2020 to about £50bn per year by the end of this decade, and to stay at that level until 2050. But only £9bn-12bn of that amount (in 2020 prices) would need to be public money, significantly less than Labour’s original scheme. </p>

其规模可能也超过了所需。建议政府进行气候转型的气候变化委员会（CCC）估计，实现净零目标需要公共和私人在绿色项目上的总投资从2020年的每年约1000亿英镑增加到本十年末的每年约5000亿英镑，并在此水平上保持到2050年。但其中只有900亿至1200亿英镑（以2020年价格计）需要是公共资金，远低于工党最初的计划。


<p>The heft of the programme skewed Labour’s plans. Out of a possible £224bn of spending envisaged under the original scheme, only £68bn had actually been earmarked for projects. But the commitment had the effect of crowding out other spending. The party has announced almost no new additional capital expenditure elsewhere. Members of the shadow cabinet hoped they could recast things like repairs to ageing schools as decarbonisation measures in order to qualify for green funds. </p>

该计划的规模使得工党的规划偏斜。根据最初设想的可能高达2,240亿英镑（约3,170亿美元）的开支，实际上只预留了680亿英镑用于具体项目。但是，这一承诺的效果是挤出了其他领域的开支。该党几乎没有宣布在其他地方新增几乎没有任何新的资本支出。影子内阁成员希望他们可以把维修老化学校的项目重塑为减少碳排放措施，从而有资格获得绿色资金。


<p>If ditching the £28bn number makes sense, however, today’s announcement still raises difficult questions for Labour. The party says that it will go ahead with plans to create a state-owned energy company and to insulate homes, albeit at a reduced pace, and that its goal of decarbonising Britain’s electricity supply by 2030, with private investment doing the heavy lifting, remains intact. That ambition already seems deeply improbable given delays to the Hinkley Point <small>C</small> nuclear-power station; and spending less than the <small>CCC </small>recommends each year would make it harder to reach longer-term goals. </p>

然而，如果放弃280亿英镑的数字确实有意义，那么今天的公告仍然为工党提出了艰难的问题。该党表示，尽管会放慢速度，但它将推进创建国有能源公司的计划，并为房屋绝缘化，其目标是到2030年通过私人投资实现英国电力供应的脱碳，这一雄心勃勃的目标似乎已经非常不可能实现，原因包括欣克利角C核电站项目的延误；而每年支出少于世界银行(World Bank)推荐的数额将使更难达到长期目标。


<p>The curtailed programme also does nothing to resolve the fundamental tension in Labour’s climate policy: whether its “Green Prosperity Plan” is primarily about greening the economy or making it more prosperous. The party still promises a “national wealth fund”, with £7.3bn in capitalisation to invest in schemes such as hydrogen manufacturing and ports, as well as a “British jobs bonus” that would offer up to £500m a year in capital grants to firms that set up in poor regions. Ed Miliband, the shadow environment secretary, often complains that although Britain has rapidly expanded offshore wind generation, many of the turbines are operated by foreign state-owned firms such as Denmark’s Ørsted. </p>

这个缩减的计划也没有解决工党气候政策的根本紧张：其“绿色繁荣计划”主要是关于使经济更加环保，还是使其更加繁荣。

该政党仍然承诺设立一个“国家财富基金”，初始资本化为73亿英镑，用于投资氢制造、港口等项目，同时也包括一个“英国就业奖金”，每年最多提供50亿英镑的资本拨款给在贫困地区设立的公司。

反对党环境事务副秘书埃德·米利班德经常抱怨说，尽管英国迅速扩大了海上风能发电，但许多涡轮机都是由丹麦奥斯陆等外国国营企业运营的。


<p>Yet money spent to subsidise the manufacturing of wind turbines and the like in Britain over cheaper foreign imports raises the cost of net zero overall. And that is money which cannot be spent on more efficient drivers of the transition, such as consumer subsidies to encourage people to buy electric cars and heat pumps. Sir Keir’s climate <small>U</small>-turn has been a long time in coming but a bigger rethink is still needed. ■ </p>

然而，英国为补贴风力涡轮机等的制造业生产，而花费的资金超过了更便宜的外国进口产品，总体上增加了实现碳中和的成本。而这部分钱本可以用于支持过渡期更高效的推动力，比如消费者补贴来鼓励购买电动汽车和热泵。

Sir Keir 的气候变化政策大转弯已经等待了很久，但还需要更大的思考调整。■
