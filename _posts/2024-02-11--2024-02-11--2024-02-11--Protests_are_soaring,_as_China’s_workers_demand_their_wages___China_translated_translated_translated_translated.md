<div></div><p><span>“W</span><small>hether you’ve</small> got money or not, do go home for lunar new year.” So goes a sentimental Chinese pop song. This year’s Spring Festival, as the occasion is also known, begins on February 10th. In recent weeks millions of China’s migrant workers, who spend most of the year toiling in cities, have been travelling back to their villages to celebrate with their families. Some are returning with hard-earned cash, which they might stuff into red envelopes (per tradition) and give to their children. Others, though, are coming home empty-handed—not because they are lazy, but because they have not been paid. </p>

“不管你有钱没钱，一定要回家过春节。”一首怀旧的中国流行歌曲如是唱道。今年的春节——又称农历新年——将于2月10日拉开序幕。近几周，数百万在中国城市辛勤劳作的农民工已经开始踏上回乡之路，与家人共度佳节。有些人带着辛苦赚来的现金回家，按照传统，他们可能会把钱装进红包，分发给孩子们。然而，也有一些人两手空空地回到家——并不是因为他们懒惰，而是因为他们没有拿到工资。

Migrant workers are rarely given formal employment contracts. China’s state-run labour unions (independent ones are banned) often side with management in disputes. So companies are under little pressure to pay workers in a timely manner. Sometimes, when business is bad, they refuse to pay them at all. Tensions typically come to a head in the period before the Spring Festival, when migrant workers scramble to get months of back pay before going home.</p>

在中国，未支付的工资是一个长期存在的问题。农民工很少被给予正式的劳动合同。中国的国营劳动者工会（禁止独立工会）在纠纷中常常站在管理层一边。因此，企业几乎没有压力来及时支付工人薪资。有时候，当生意不好时，他们甚至拒绝支付任何报酬。紧张局势通常会在春节前达到顶峰，此时农民工急于在回家之前拿到数月的拖欠工资。

Protests over unpaid wages in the period before the Spring Festival have doubled compared with last year, according to data from China Labour Bulletin, a watchdog organisation in Hong Kong (see chart). Several local governments have voiced concerns. The “severity and complexity of the situation cannot be ignored”, said the Communist Party boss of Huaibei, a city in the eastern province of Anhui, last month. </p><p>Many of those demanding back pay are construction workers, of which China has about 52m. Four years ago the government introduced policies designed to cool an overheating property market. But the measures proved too effective, sending the industry into crisis. Meanwhile, the uncertainty of the pandemic caused potential buyers to save their money instead. As a result of all this, many developers halted big projects—and many workers on those projects have not been paid. </p><p>One of them is Zhang Yongyin, who is from Guizhou, a poor province in the south-west of China. Last summer he worked on a project by Evergrande, a property behemoth that has been crippled by debt. Mr Zhang says he is still owed 30,000 yuan ($4,220) by one of the subcontractors. He needs the money to pay his mortgage and buy his child new clothes. “Everyone doing construction work has lost heart,” he says.</p><p>Unpaid workers often band together to put pressure on companies. Some block roads. Others are more creative. In January a group of workers at a factory in Zhejiang province threatened to jump off a government building unless they were paid. Such stunts are usually posted online to drum up support. (The group did not jump.)</p></div><div><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p>The central government says it wants to help. In December officials launched a campaign to “eradicate” the problem of unpaid wages, threatening to punish recalcitrant firms. But previous efforts have had little effect. Although the government can force state-owned companies to cough up, it has little sway over the private contractors that are at the heart of the problem, says Aidan Chau of China Labour Bulletin. </p>

中国政府说要提供援助。去年12月，官员们发起了一项“根除”欠薪问题的运动，并威胁要惩罚顽固不化的公司。但之前的努力收效甚微。正如中国劳工研究会的艾丹·肖所说，虽然政府可以迫使国有企业支付，但它对问题的核心——私营承建商——几乎没有影响力。


<p>In any case, the government is more concerned about social stability. That means it often targets workers, too. Officials fume about “illegal gatherings” aimed at shaming companies. A county in the western province of Gansu has threatened to punish workers for the dangerous act of displaying banners during protests.</p>

无论如何，政府更关心社会稳定。这意味着它经常也会对工人目标进行打击。官员们对旨在羞辱公司的“非法集会”怒气冲冲。甘肃省西部的一个县甚至威胁要惩罚抗议期间展示横幅的工人，这一行为被视为危险举动。


<p>At an informal labour market in southern Beijing, two dozen workers recently waited in the cold, hoping to earn a little extra money before heading home for the holiday. Few jobs are on offer, though. It has been a tough year, they say. The workers at least take some comfort in their shared hardship. Going home with no money would usually be humiliating. But this year, says Mr Zhang, many of his neighbours have no money either. <span>■</span></p>

在北京南部一个非正式的劳动力市场，最近有二十多位工人冒着严寒等待，希望能赚点额外的钱再回家过节。然而，提供的工作机会寥寥无几。他们说，今年过得相当艰难。

至少这些工人们能在共同的困苦中找到一些安慰。通常来说，带着没有钱回家会让人感到羞耻。但张先生说，今年他的许多邻居也拿不出钱来。
