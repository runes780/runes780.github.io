<div></div><p><span>L</span><small>ove conquers</small> all. But it also makes allowances for changing consumer behaviour. The covid-19 pandemic, the cost-of-living squeeze and even Brexit have changed the way that Britons approach Valentine’s Day, the annual celebration of romance/opportunity to have a blazing row with your partner. </p>

爱情能征服一切。但它也适应了不断变化的消费者行为。COVID-19大流行、生活成本紧缩甚至Brexit都改变了英国人庆祝情人节的方式，这个一年一度的节日是为了浪漫而设立/也是一个与伴侣爆发激烈争吵的机会。


<p>Loved-up Britons are more likely to stay in on February 14th than they were a few years ago because of tighter budgets and hybrid lifestyles. On average consumers now spend 66 more minutes at home every day compared with the pre-lockdown era. On Valentine’s Day last year just over 8m people used London’s buses and tube network, around 22% fewer than did so on the same day in 2020. Spending at restaurants fell by 11.6% in January year on year. </p>

相爱的英国人由于预算紧张和混合生活方式，比几年前更有可能在2月14日待在家里。与疫情封锁前相比，消费者现在平均每天多花66分钟在家。去年情人节当天，大约有800万人使用伦敦的公交和地铁网络，比2020年同一天减少了约22%。一月份，餐厅消费下降了11.6%（与上年同期相比）。


<div><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p>Those couples who decide to eat in on Valentine’s Day this year have more options than they did before covid. Some restaurants now offer their own <small>DIY</small> meal kits, delivering the ingredients and recipes for chef-crafted meals directly to diners’ homes. A wealth of pandemic-born businesses have ditched bricks and mortar altogether. YHangry, an online platform, allows users to hire private chefs to provide a restaurant-style meal at home. </p>

今年情人节决定在家享用晚餐的情侣们，比疫情前有了更多选择。一些餐馆现在提供自己的DIY餐盒套装，直接将厨师精心制作的菜肴所需食材和食谱送到食客家中。

众多在疫情期间诞生的企业已经完全放弃了实体店。比如在线平台YHangry，用户可以通过它聘请私人厨师，在家中享用如同餐厅般的美食。


<p>Singletons can be homebodies, too. The period between Christmas and Valentine’s Day is peak season for dating apps: matches between Tinder users globally were 10% higher than normal in the run-up to February 14th last year. But some of these matches opt for virtual dates. Around 6% of those polled in Britain will meet with a romantic prospect online this Valentine’s Day, slightly more than in Europe, a survey by GlobalWebIndex, a research firm, shows. </p>

单例模式也可以是居家派。从圣诞节到情人节之间的时期，是约会应用的旺季：去年2月14日之前，全球Tinder用户的配对量比平时高出10%。但其中一些配对选择虚拟约会。根据全球网络指数（一家研究公司）的一项调查显示，在英国，大约6%的受访者计划在这个情人节在网上与浪漫的人见面，略高于欧洲的比例。


<p>Frugality will affect gift choices. Around 43% of Britons are currently tightening their belts, according to a survey by Barclays, a British bank. Half of those planning to buy flowers on February 14th are intending to skip the florist and pick them up at the supermarket instead. </p>

节俭将影响礼品选择。根据英国巴克莱银行进行的一项调查，目前大约有43%的英国人正在勒紧裤腰带。其中有一半计划在2月14日情人节当天购买鲜花的人，打算跳过花店，直接去超市选购。

<p>The blooms they buy are changing. Brexit-related border checks that kicked in on January 31st make importing flowers a more arduous process this year, and when demand is so time-sensitive, any delay can be disastrous. Some florists were already turning away from red roses and opting for homegrown flowers such as snowdrops or tulips instead. “Valentine’s Day creates a huge and unnecessary spike in demand for red roses which rapidly unwinds the following day, risking high levels of waste,” says Aron Gelbard, <small>CEO</small> and founder of Bloom and Wild, an online flower-delivery service. “We stopped selling them in 2021.” <span>■</span></p>

花店购买的花卉正在发生变化。自2021年1月31日起实施与英国脱欧相关的边境检查，今年进口花卉的过程变得更加艰难。而在需求如此时间敏感的情况下，任何延误都可能导致灾难。

一些花店已经开始远离红玫瑰，转而选择种植在家中的花卉，如雪花莲或郁金香。“情人节期间，对红玫瑰的需求突然大幅增加，但这在第二天就会迅速下降，从而带来大量浪费的风险。”在线鲜花递送服务Bloom and Wild的首席执行官兼创始人Aron Gelbard说，“我们在2021年就已经停止销售它们了。”■
