<div></div><p><span>O</span><small>N FEBRUARY 1ST</small> President Joe Biden issued an executive order imposing sanctions on four individuals “undermining peace, security and stability in the West Bank”. Violence there has increased sharply since Hamas’s attack on Israel on October 7th. On October 11th four Palestinians were killed by settlers in Qusra, a village; two more were shot dead during their funeral procession. By November 860 Palestinians had been forced to leave their homes, according to the United Nations. Who are the settlers in the West Bank—and why has their presence led to decades of violence?</p>

一月一日，美国总统乔·拜登签署了一项行政命令，对四位“在西岸破坏和平、安全与稳定”的个人实施制裁。自10月7日哈马斯对以色列发起攻击以来，那里的暴力活动急剧上升。10月11日，四名巴勒斯坦人在库萨村被定居者杀害；另有两人在他们的葬礼游行中被开枪打死。据联合国统计，至11月8日，已有600多名巴勒斯坦人被迫离开家园。那么西岸的定居者是谁——为什么他们存在会导致数十年的暴力冲突？


<p>Settlements are communities—a mixture of towns and villages—built by Israeli Jews on occupied land outside the internationally recognised borders of Israel. There were once settlements in the Egyptian Sinai and in Gaza. Today there are a small number in the Golan Heights, which is occupied Syrian territory. But the vast majority are in the West Bank. </p>

定居点是社区——城镇和村庄的混合体——由以色列犹太人在国际公认边界之外占领的土地上建立的。过去在埃及西奈和加沙有定居点。如今，在被占领的叙利亚领土戈兰高地上有少数定居点。但绝大多数都在西岸。


<div><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p>The first settlements in the West Bank were established in 1967, when Israel occupied the land after the Six Day War with Jordan, Egypt and Syria. Some were funded and sanctioned by the Israeli government, with the help of the World Zionist Organisation. Some settlers argued that they had religious claims to the land. Others said that they were reclaiming property lost in the war that Israel fought in 1948 against neighbouring Arab countries. Levi Eshkol, then Israel’s prime minister, saw the occupied territories as bargaining chips in any future negotiations with the Palestinians. Some members of his government argued that the settlements could act as a security buffer for Israel.</p>

1967年六日战争后，以色列占领了约旦河西岸的土地。这些领土上的首批定居点随之建立。

有些定居点由以色列政府资助和批准设立，世界犹太人组织也提供了帮助。一些定居者认为他们对这片土地有宗教上的权利主张。另一些人则表示他们在重夺1948年以色列与邻近阿拉伯国家作战期间失去的财产。

当时的以色列总理莱维·伊舒科尔将占领领土视为未来与巴勒斯坦人谈判时的筹码。他的政府中也有一些成员认为，定居点可以作为保障以色列安全的一道屏障。

In 1993 the Oslo Accords, an agreement between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation, banned the construction of new sites. But settlers were soon building again. In the three decades after the accords were signed, the number of settlements grew almost three-fold. Many of those were established without government approval; some were retroactively rubber stamped. </p><p>There are now 460,000 Israelis living in settlements in the West Bank (excluding East Jerusalem), most close to the border. Around a third are <a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/11/06/settlers-are-causing-mayhem-in-the-west-bank">“ideological” settlers</a>, many of whom live deeper in the West Bank. They enjoy considerable public support in Israel. And their numbers continue to rise. During the first six months of Israel’s current coalition government, led by Binyamin Netanyahu, 12,000 new housing units in West Bank settlements were approved, according to Peace Now, an Israeli advocacy group. </p><p>Incidents of settler violence against Palestinians were poorly recorded until the 1980s. By then they were becoming a pronounced problem. The Jewish Underground, an Israeli terrorist group, was determined to sabotage the Camp David Accords, signed by Israel and Egypt in 1978, which granted Palestinians autonomy. It feared the agreement could lead to an independent West Bank and threaten settlements. The group planned to blow up the Dome of the Rock, a mosque in East Jerusalem that is among the holiest sites in Islam. But after a Palestinian terrorist attack on Israeli students in 1980, it instead carried out a series of bombings against Arab mayors. Its targets were not all politicians. In 1983 Jewish Underground killed three Arab students and injured more than 30 others in an attack on Hebron University in the West Bank.</p><p> In 1993, after the end of the first intifada, when Palestinians rose up against Israel, the number of attacks by Israeli civilians on Palestinians rose again. Settlers received weapons from the Israeli army for self-defence. That year B’Tselem, an Israeli human-rights organisation, recorded a marked increase in violence by settlers. Shootings, beatings, roadblocks and vandalism increased. In a small fraction of those cases settlers were acting in self defence. Most attacks were designed to intimidate Palestinians living among settlements. Organised violence continued, too. In 1994 Baruch Goldstein, a settler member of Kach, a far-right movement, opened fire in a mosque in Hebron, killing 29 Palestinians. </p></div><p>The number of attacks has not abated in recent years, with more than 1,400 cases recorded between 2005 and 2021, according to Yesh Din, an Israeli watchdog. More than 90% of complaints were dropped by Israeli authorities, who run law enforcement in settler areas, without charges being filed. And settlers’ tactics are becoming more varied. In recent years some have uprooted olive trees during harvest, depriving many Palestinian families of a source of income. Tensions are rising as a result. Many observers fear another uprising in the West Bank might be imminent. <span>■</span></p>

近年来，攻击事件并未减少。据以色列监督机构Yesh Din统计，在2005年至2021年间记录的案件超过1400起。其中，90%以上的投诉最终被以色列当局搁置——在定居点地区执行法律执法的机构，并未对此进行指控。

而且，定居者的行为策略也越来越多样化。近年来，有些人在橄榄收获季节拔掉橄榄树，剥夺了许多巴勒斯坦家庭的重要收入来源。由此导致的紧张局势正在上升。许多观察人士担心，新一轮的巴以冲突可能即将在约旦河西岸爆发。
