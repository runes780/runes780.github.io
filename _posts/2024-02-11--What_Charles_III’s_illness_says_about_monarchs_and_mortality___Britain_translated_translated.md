<div></div><p><span>B</span><small>ritain has</small> always been interested in its kings’ bodies. Each age has had its own particular obsession. For Shakespeare, it was the king’s head—the mortal brow beneath the hollow crown—that fascinated. After the Restoration it was the king’s hand—Charles II was believed to be able to heal diseases by touch alone. Now national attention has turned to the state of <a href="https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/09/15/what-sort-of-king-will-charles-iii-be">Charles III’s</a> health. </p>

英国一直对国王的身体有着浓厚的兴趣。每个时代都有自己独特的痴迷点。对于莎士比亚来说，吸引他的是国王的头部——那颗嵌在空洞王冠下的凡人前额。

恢复君主制后，人们的关注转向了国王的手部——查理二世被认为仅凭触摸就能治愈疾病，这赋予了他的手以超自然的力量。

现在，全国的目光都集中在查理三世健康状况上。随着王室的公共角色发生变化，公众对王室成员健康和福祉的关注也在增加。


<p>According to a statement from Buckingham Palace on February 5th, “a separate issue of concern was noted” while the king was being treated for an enlarged prostate. Subsequent tests “identified a form of cancer”. Quite which form has not been announced; a little royal distance remains. But when future historians come to chronicle the change from a “magical” monarchy, able to heal by touch alone, to the more humdrum mortal kind, this moment may feature: few things seem more mortal or less magical than a prostate. </p>

根据2月5日白金汉宫发表的声明，国王在接受前列腺肿大治疗的同时，“注意到一个单独但令人担忧的问题”。随后的测试“识别出一种癌症形式”。具体是哪种类型还未公布；王室仍保持着一点距离。然而，当未来的历史学家们记录从一个“神奇”的王权转变为更平凡、凡人的过程时，这个时刻可能会包含以下内容：没有什么比前列腺更让人感受到生命的短暂和非同寻常了。


<div><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p>In the past monarchies have been less willing to admit to frailty, as have their physicians. When George VI had his entire left lung removed in 1951 because of lung cancer, the public (and indeed the king himself) were told that this was due to “structural abnormalities”. When his grandfather, the high-living Edward VII, collapsed in Biarritz, it was at once entirely unsurprising—Edward smoked, drank and ate so abundantly that he couldn’t do up the bottom buttons on his waistcoat—and, at first, entirely unspoken about. An attempt to treat the king was made, including through the application of his favourite mistress. But even she failed to revive him. </p>

在过去，君主们往往不愿意承认自己的脆弱，他们的医生也是如此。1951年，由于肺癌，乔治六世不得不完全切除他左侧的整个肺脏。公众（甚至包括国王本人）被告知，这是由“结构性异常”引起的。当他祖父、生活奢侈的爱德华七世在比亚里茨摔倒时，这立刻显得毫不意外——爱德华吸烟、酗酒，饮食极其丰富，以至于他的背心上最下面的扣子都扣不上了——而且最初是完全未公开讨论的。曾试图治疗国王，包括通过给他最喜欢的情人应用的方法。但即使是她也没能让他复活。


<p>The monarch’s mortality feels all the more salient when they come to the throne late. Elizabeth II ascended to the throne at the age of 25; when the congregation at her coronation in 1953 sang “Long to reign over us” they could feel confident that she, with the pinchably plump flesh of youth, would do just that. In contrast, at his coronation last year Charles—the longest-serving heir-apparent—was already 74. </p>

当他们晚年才登基时，君主的死亡感觉更为显著。伊丽莎白二世在25岁时即位；1953年她加冕典礼上的会众，在唱“愿你长久统治我们”时，可以确信这位有着青春饱满肉体（尽管可能略显丰满）的女王，会如此做。相比之下，去年加冕时，查尔斯——在位时间最长的王储——已经74岁了。


<p>A monarch is not a country incarnate but they are not far off. If <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/09/08/the-death-of-elizabeth-ii-marks-the-end-of-an-era">Elizabeth II</a>—dutiful, stable and influential—embodied one era, it feels uncomfortably as though Charles III—also dutiful, but ageing and now battling ill health—might represent another. Then again, as Shakespeare makes clear, a king is also just a man. The crown might be bejewelled; the royal crest might sit on the press releases. But the king beneath is mortal, and increasingly open about it. <span>■</span></p>

**中文翻译：**

国王并非国家的化身，但两者确实相去不远。如果说伊丽莎白二世（忠诚、稳定且颇具影响力）代表了一个时代，那么查尔斯三世（同样忠诚，但年事已高，并正与健康问题作斗争）似乎就预示了另一个时代。然而，正如莎士比亚所明确指出的那样，国王本质上也只是个凡人。

皇冠可能镶嵌着宝石；皇家纹章或许会出现在新闻发布稿上。但在这些辉煌外表之下，国王仍然是有生之年的个体，而且越来越公开地面对这个事实。
