<div></div><p><span>S</span><small>hiny cars</small> line the streets of Ngor, a suburb of Dakar. Beside the occasional passing sheep are telltale signs of wealth—ice cream shops and gyms—that should be enticing to banks offering mortgages. Yet loans are hard to come by. Sam Thianar and his family live in two rooms of the apartment block he is building. The rest he hopes to rent out. Although construction started years ago, the building is a mess of concrete and exposed wires. “When I save a little money, I buy some sand and cement and build a little more,” he says. He applied for a loan of 10m <small>CFA</small> francs ($16,500) from a credit mutual, but was rejected. Nearby Ibrahima Diouf, a 45-year-old, shovels sand to make bricks. Could he ever get a mortgage? “Never, never, never,” he replies. </p>

在达喀尔郊区恩戈，光鲜亮丽的车辆穿梭在街道上。偶尔有放牧的绵羊路过，但更显财富迹象的是冰淇淋店和健身房，这些设施本应吸引提供房贷的银行。然而，贷款却难以获得。

Sam Thianar和他的家人居住在一个正在建造的公寓楼的两个房间里。其余的部分他希望能租出去。尽管施工开始多年，但这座建筑仍然混乱不堪，混凝土和裸露的电线随处可见。

“每当我存了一点钱，我就会买一些沙子和水泥，再建一点。”他说道。

他曾向一家信用合作社申请一笔10亿西非法郎（约16,500美元）的贷款，但遭到了拒绝。附近，45岁的Ibrahima Diouf正在铲沙做砖。他有可能获得房贷吗？

“永远不会，永远不会，永远不会。”他回答道。


<div><figure><span><img alt="" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/704/90/media-assets/image/20240210_MAC308.png"/></span></figure><p>The struggle to finance and build homes is contributing to a profound housing crisis in sub-Saharan Africa. In almost all African countries even the very cheapest new home is too expensive for a typical teacher or police officer with the mortgage they could obtain, according to the Centre for Affordable Housing Finance (<small>CAHF</small>) in Africa, a research outfit in South Africa (see chart). Instead many Africans live in housing without toilets or reliable electricity. Some 230m people, half of all urban dwellers in Africa, live in slums, a number that is rising because of urbanisation and population growth. </p></div><div><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><div><figure><span><img alt="" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/781/90/media-assets/image/20240210_MAC302.png"/></span></figure><p>Yet Africa’s need for housing is also a tremendous opportunity. A mind-bending 70% of the buildings expected in Africa in 2040 do not exist, reckons the <small>UN</small>. Building them could be a boon not just for slum-dwellers but for growth, jobs and, potentially, climate-friendly construction. Africa will be the construction site of the world, enthuses Ian Shapiro of Reall, an investor in African housing.</p><p> The main reason for this chronic shortage of housing lies with how homes are built now. Perhaps 90% are self-built, usually incrementally over many years. Cities are thus riddled with unfinished buildings. Some buy their homes from developers, where they pay a portion up front, more during construction and the rest on completion. Yet if developers do not sell enough apartments in the building or hit other troubles, then everything stops. “It puts the risk on the buyer,” says Seeta Shah of <small>FSD</small> Kenya, a financial think-tank. “You could get burned, or you could get your home.” </p><p>Both ways of building tie up scarce capital in cement that houses no one and earns nothing for years. And because of the tight finances, truly large-scale housing projects are rare. </p><p>Building quality homes in Africa also involves a fiendishly complex set of tasks—from buying land and wrangling title to persuading governments to install water to the area and finding a buyer. Finishing one step often depends on progress in all the others. And each needs financing. “It’s a dance, it’s not a straight line,” says Kecia Rust of <small>CAHF</small>.</p></div><div><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p> The cheapest newly built house generally costs the equivalent of $20,000-40,000. Yet income per person is only about $1,700. The high cost is partly caused by red tape. In Kenya, for example, there are 140 laws, policies and regulations relating to affordable housing. Building codes, which often date back to the colonial era, also set inappropriate standards. In Kenya a car park is required for any two-bedroom home. The result is that those who build formally cannot build cheaply. Many small builders dodge regulations. That makes them cheaper but often more dangerous. </p>

最便宜的新建房屋通常价格相当于20,000-40,000美元。然而，每个人的平均收入只有大约1,700美元。高昂的成本部分是由繁文缛节造成的。例如，在肯尼亚，有140项法律、政策和规定涉及经济适用房。常常追溯到殖民时代的建筑规范也设定了不适当的标准。在肯尼亚，任何两居室的住宅都需要配有一个停车场。结果是，那些正规建造的人就无法低成本地建造。许多小型建筑商都会规避法规，这使得他们更加便宜，但往往也更危险。


<p>The lack of land titles also hits supply and drives up prices. Developers need this paperwork before they can build; without it they risk losing the entire investment. Yet just 4% of countries in Africa have mapped and registered the private land in their capital cities. On average it costs more than 7% of the value of the property to register it. In parts of Nigeria this cost reaches 20%.</p>

同样，土地确权不到位也会制约供应，推高价格。开发商在施工前需要这些文件；没有这些文件，他们面临投资全部损失的风险。然而，在非洲只有4%的国家对首都城市内的私人土地进行了测绘和登记。

平均而言，注册财产价值超过7%的成本是必不可少的。而在尼日利亚的部分地区，这个成本甚至达到了20%。


<p>Weak titles also make it harder for people to borrow. This is because banks will generally refuse to lend against a property if the ownership of it is fuzzy. That is one reason why there are vanishingly few mortgages in Africa. Uganda, with almost 50m people, has about 7,000 mortgages outstanding. It is not an extreme case. In most sub-Saharan countries the stock of mortgage debt to <small>GDP</small> is lower than 1%. By comparison, in Britain it is 65%. A second reason is that perhaps 85% of people have informal jobs, such as selling fruit at the market or riding a motorbike taxi. As such they do not have pay slips that could prove to banks that they can afford to repay a loan. A third is that many Africans need a loan to start building a home, but banks are especially reluctant to lend if the only collateral is undeveloped land. </p>

其次，大约85%的人口从事非正式工作，例如在市场上卖水果或驾驶摩托车出租车。因此，他们没有工资单，无法向银行证明他们有能力偿还贷款。

第三个原因在于，许多非洲人需要贷款来开始建造房屋。然而，如果唯一的抵押品是未开发的土地，银行会特别不愿发放贷款。


<p>Bigger financial forces push up mortgage rates and sharply limit the number of loans available, too. A rule of thumb is that mortgage rates need to be in single digits to have a chance of being affordable, says Simon Walley of the World Bank. Yet just 15 out of 48 countries for which there are data in sub-Saharan Africa have rates below 10%. That is firstly because central-bank rates, a floor for mortgages, are persistently high to curb inflation. Compounding the problem is the scarcity of long-term finance in Africa and the fact that governments grab most of it. Banks and investors can earn 13-15% a year simply by buying government bonds. Setting up a retail banking business, finding customers, trying to measure the credit risk of people with no pay slips and fuzzy collateral involves an awful lot of effort —and risk—in comparison. </p>

更大的金融力量推动抵押贷款利率上升，并显著限制可用贷款的数量。一个常用的规则是，抵押贷款利率需要在个位数以内，才有可能负担得起，世界银行的Simon Walley说。

然而，在撒哈拉以南非洲的48个国家中，只有15个国家的数据表明其利率低于10%。首先是因为中央银行的利率持续高位运行，以抑制通货膨胀。问题更加复杂的是，非洲长期融资稀缺，而政府往往会占据大部分资金。银行和投资者只需购买政府债券，就能每年获得约13-15%的回报。

相比之下，开设零售银行业务、寻找客户、尝试衡量没有工资单和模糊抵押品的人们的信贷风险，这需要大量的努力——以及风险。


<p>There have been efforts in recent years to make mortgages cheaper, often by setting up mortgage-refinance companies. These are usually owned by clubs of banks, backed by governments and get cheap loans and equity from development-finance institutions (<small>DFI</small>s), such as the World Bank. This allows them to borrow more cheaply in capital markets than banks can. The refinance companies then pass on their lower borrowing rates to banks to achieve cheaper mortgages. Eight countries in west Africa jointly have such a firm while Kenya, Tanzania and Nigeria each have one. These have helped, but nowhere near enough. </p>

近年来，人们一直在努力降低房贷成本，通常通过成立房贷再融资公司来实现。这些公司通常是银行俱乐部所有，得到政府支持，并且能从发展金融机构（DFIs）如世界银行那里获得便宜的贷款和股权。这使得它们能够在资本市场上以比银行更低的成本筹集更多资金。

然后再融资公司将较低的借款利率传递给银行，从而实现更便宜的房贷。西非共有8个国家拥有这样的公司，而肯尼亚、坦桑尼亚和尼日利亚各自都有一个。这些公司的帮助是有成效的，但远远不够。


<div><div><div id="econ-3"></div></div></div><p>In Tanzania, which has a population of 67m, the mortgage-refinance company directly backs only 1,500 outstanding mortgages. In Kenya, with a population of 56m, the mortgage-refinance company has backed just 2,876 loans in almost five years, less than a tenth of its target. Mr Walley of the World Bank, which has lent to most of these companies, says the problem is that “the housing supply response hasn’t happened, or not to the scale we would have liked”. High underlying interest rates also limit their impact, says Aliou Maïga of the International Finance Corporation (<small>IFC</small>), the private-sector arm of the World Bank. He also points to a tougher problem: poverty. “Whatever you do, it’s very very difficult to fit income levels into the housing equation,” he says. </p>

在拥有6700万人口的坦桑尼亚，房贷再融资公司直接支持的仅剩1500笔待偿还贷款。而在拥有5600万人口的肯尼亚，房贷再融资公司在过去近五年时间里仅提供了2876笔贷款支持，这个数字还不到其设定目标的十分之一。

世界银行（World Bank）的威尔利·沃雷尔（Mr. Walley of the World Bank）表示，这些问题的主要症结在于“住房供应方面的响应并没有发生，或者发生的规模远未达到我们所希望的程度”。

同时，高企的基准利率也限制了这些措施的影响。国际金融公司（IFC）、世界银行私营部门的分支机构的阿里乌·玛伊加（Aliou Maïga of the International Finance Corporation）指出这一点，并指出了更深层次的问题：贫困。

“无论你做什么，都非常非常困难将收入水平融入住房解决方案中。”他说道。


<p>All this is prompting a radical rethink. Mr Walley thinks mortgages in Africa can reach a wider scale some day, but says that currently, at best, they are going to serve the richest 5-15% of the population. Mr Maïga is blunter: “Acquisition by individuals and the mortgage, to me, are not necessarily the right instrument in Africa.” That is striking, given that the <small>IFC</small> partly owns and finances the mortgage-refinance companies in west Africa, Tanzania and Kenya. The <small>IFC </small>is now resetting its housing strategy altogether. </p>

所有这一切都促使人们彻底重新思考。沃利先生认为，终有一天，非洲的按揭贷款可以达到更大的规模，但目前来说，充其量也只会为最富有的5%至15%的人口服务。马伊加先生则更为直白：“个人购置以及按揭贷款，在我看来，并不一定在非洲是正确的工具。”这番言论令人印象深刻，因为IFC部分拥有并资助了西非、坦桑尼亚和肯尼亚的按揭再融资公司。现在，IFC正在全面调整其住房战略。


<p>If mortgages modelled on the rich world are not right for Africa, what is? One answer is to embrace the reality that African houses are often self-built in stages. Banks are starting to offer smaller shorter-term loans to enable families to, for example, build an extra room to rent out. Housing Finance Bank (<small>HFB</small>) in Uganda does just this. Its loans are typically for three years and average about $4,000. The bank requires some collateral, but dodges the headaches of formal title by accepting sales agreements for land or even just belongings like a motorbike or fridge along with a guarantor. “The performance of these loans is good,” says Michael Mugabi, <small>HFB</small>’s managing director. “They don’t default.” Because the loan allows an extension to be completed without delay, it is an efficient use of capital. </p>

如果根据富裕世界模式设计的抵押贷款不适合非洲，那么什么合适呢？一个答案是接受这样的现实：非洲房屋往往是分阶段自建而成。银行开始提供较小、期限较短的贷款，以帮助家庭完成例如增加一间可出租房间的建设。乌干达的住房融资银行（Housing Finance Bank, HFB）就是这样做的。其贷款通常为期三年，平均金额约为4000美元。银行要求一些抵押品，但为了避免正式产权带来的头痛问题，银行接受土地销售协议，甚至仅仅是摩托车或冰箱等财物的销售协议，同时还需要有担保人。“这些贷款的表现良好。”HFB的执行董事迈克尔·穆加比（Michael Mugabi）说，“它们不会违约。”因为贷款允许延期在不拖延的情况下完成，所以它是资本的有效利用。

<h2>Tinker, tailor</h2><p>Such loans still require clever ways of assessing the creditworthiness of informal workers. Syntellect, an Indian startup, is trying to help with machine learning. An algorithm is fed the results of a questionnaire tailored to the borrower’s trade—from street-food vendor to tailor—and also uses utility payments, mobile money records and geolocation intelligence about whether, say, a street vendor has wealthy potential clientele nearby. It recently signed up with Kenya’s largest microfinance organisation to help with credit decisions for housing loans. </p>

这类贷款仍然需要巧妙的方式来评估非正式工人（如街头小贩、裁缝）的信用状况。印度初创公司Syntellect正在利用机器学习来提供帮助。算法会接收一个专门针对借款人行业（从街头小吃摊主到裁缝）定制的调查问卷的结果。此外，它还会使用公用事业付款、移动货币记录以及关于街头商贩是否在附近拥有富裕潜在客户群的地缘情报。最近，它已与肯尼亚最大的微型金融机构签约，以帮助其作出购房贷款的信用决策。


<p>Others see more hope in bigger developers because they may solve the problem of bank loans for new builds. Unity Homes, a developer in Kenya and Nigeria, uses the value of its undeveloped land to provide mortgage banks with financial guarantees that it will complete construction projects. This gives the banks the security they need to lend to customers buying homes before they are completed. </p>

另一些人则对大型开发商抱有更多希望，因为他们可能解决新房建设银行贷款的问题。肯尼亚和尼日利亚的开发商Unity Homes，利用其未开发土地的价值为抵押银行提供财务保证，即它将完成建筑项目。这给了银行必要的安全，让他们能够向购房客户贷款，这些客户在房屋完工前就购买了房子。


<p>Still, mortgages are out of reach for people who are not in formal employment. To help them, some <small>DFI</small>s and private firms are experimenting with rental and rent-to-own models. Housing needs to be approached like big infrastructure projects, says Mr Maïga of <small>IFC</small>. By that he means very large developments built by private firms where governments, institutional investors and <small>DFI</small>s guarantee to buy the homes. Families then rent or rent-to-buy from these institutional owners. Rent-to-buy removes the need for an upfront deposit. Instead renters slowly accumulate ownership over time. The <small>IFC</small> has recently agreed to pilot programmes in this style with three governments in west Africa. </p>

然而，对于非正式就业人员而言，购房仍然是遥不可及的事情。为帮助他们，一些多边金融机构（DFIs）和私营企业正在尝试租赁、租售同权等模式。

IFC的马伊加先生表示，住房需求应当像大型基础设施项目一样来对待。这意味着由私营企业建设的超大规模开发项目，政府、机构投资者和DFI保证购买这些住宅。

然后，家庭从这些机构所有者那里租赁或租售同权。租售同权模式消除了购房者需要提前支付首付的要求。相反，租房人会随着时间慢慢积累所有权。

IFC最近已经同意与西非三个政府合作，试点这种风格的项目。


<p>Private developers are also turning to rentals. After more than a decade as a developer of large housing projects in Africa for sale to families, Daniel Font came to a worrying conclusion: “In some ways we were completely wrong.” Most people had no access to mortgages and those who did buy their units rented them out anyway, he explains. Mr Font now leads a new company, <small>SIV</small> Africa, which is building homes in Africa to rent. The company plans to own, maintain and operate the projects over a long term while also selling a share of the portfolio on capital markets. The goal is to build quality homes to rent for people who have no access to banks. “That is 90% of the population in Africa,” says Mr Font. </p>

开发商也在转向租赁业务。丹尼尔·丰特（Daniel Font）从事了十多年的非洲大型住宅项目开发，目标是卖给家庭。但他得出一个令人担忧的结论：“在某些方面，我们完全错了。”大部分人无法获得抵押贷款，即便有购房能力的人，他们也会购买单元房，并将其租出去，丰特解释道。

现在，丰特领导着一家新的公司——SIVAfrica，该公司正在非洲建造出租房屋。该公司计划长期拥有、维护和运营这些项目，并在资本市场上出售投资组合的一部分股权。目标是为无法获得银行服务的人们建设质量上乘的租赁住房。“这占到了非洲90%的人口”，丰特说。


<p>For the hundreds of millions of Africans with no chance of getting a mortgage who live in cramped, poorly lit, and often unsanitary homes, the rethink cannot happen fast enough. <span>■</span></p>

对于数亿非洲人来说，他们没有获得抵押贷款的机会，居住在狭小、光线暗淡、常常不卫生的家中，他们迫切希望这种反思能尽快到来。■
