<div></div><p><span>A</span><small>t first blush</small>, it did not seem too alarming. At Asia’s leading security conference last year, held in a glitzy ballroom at the Shangri-La hotel in Singapore, Indonesia’s defence minister, Prabowo Subianto, proposed a peace plan for Ukraine. Clad in a western suit and traditional <i>peci</i> cap, he then argued for an immediate ceasefire to establish a demilitarised buffer zone. Both Russia and Ukraine would withdraw 15km from their forward positions. The United Nations would send peacekeepers and organise a referendum to decide which country owned the disputed territory. China, a big investor in Indonesia in recent years, lauded Mr Prabowo’s vision. Ukraine’s defence minister labelled it “a Russian plan” and “strange”. </p>

乍看之下，这并不显得太过惊心动魄。去年在新加坡香格里拉酒店奢华舞厅举行的亚洲顶级安全会议上，印度尼西亚国防部长普拉博沃·苏比安托提出了一个乌克兰和平计划。他穿着西式套装和传统pecicap，随后主张立即实施停火，建立非军事化缓冲区。俄罗斯和乌克兰都将从前线位置后撤15公里。联合国将派遣维和人员，并组织全民公决，决定哪个国家拥有有争议的领土。近年来中国在印尼投资大幅增加，中国对普拉博沃先生的愿景表示赞赏。而乌克兰国防部长则称其为“俄罗斯计划”、“奇怪”。

It was that it contradicted the official policy of Indonesia, which had voted to denounce Russia’s invasion of Ukraine at the <small>UN.</small> Mr Prabowo, who is the favourite to win a presidential election on February 14th, had consulted neither the current president, Joko Widodo (“Jokowi”), nor Indonesia’s foreign ministry. For some Asia strategists, his outburst was a promise of volatile new leadership in the world’s fourth-most populous country.</p>

普拉布沃先生演讲中最奇怪的部分并非他似乎在即兴支持弗拉基米尔·普京。真正奇特的是，他的言论与印尼的官方政策相悖，印尼曾投票谴责俄罗斯入侵乌克兰的联合国决议。普拉布沃先生是2月14日即将举行的总统选举的大热门。他在咨询现任总统佐科·维多多（“Jokowi”）或印尼外交部之前就发表了这些言论。对一些亚洲战略家来说，他的这番话预示着这个全球第四人口大国将迎来动荡的新领导层。


<aside><p><i>For more on the Indonesian election, see our <a href="https://www.economist.com/interactive/2024-indonesia-election-tracker">poll tracker</a></i></p></aside><p>The former general’s record is troubling. A former son-in-law of Suharto, a dictator toppled in 1998, Mr Prabowo stands accused of committing atrocities during his decades in the army—including, at the helm of its special forces, in Indonesia’s former territory of East Timor. He is also alleged to have ordered the kidnapping of more than 20 pro-democracy activists in 1998, of whom 13 remain missing. (He denies any wrongdoing.) He was at one time barred from entering America and Australia because of these allegations.</p>

前将军的记录令人不安。苏哈托将军，这位在1998年被推翻的独裁者，其姻亲之一，普拉博沃先生，被指控在他几十年的军旅生涯中犯有暴行，包括在印度尼西亚特种部队担任领导期间，在该国前领土东帝汶所为。他还被指下令在1998年绑架了超过20位支持民主人士，其中13人仍然失踪。（他否认有任何不当行为。）他曾一度因为这些指控而被禁止进入美国和澳大利亚。


<div><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p>After losing the past two presidential elections to Jokowi, Mr Prabowo falsely claimed that the vote had been stolen. In 2019 eight people were killed after he urged his supporters to protest against the election result. He has also tried to abolish the direct election of regional leaders and has said Indonesia needs an authoritarian leader. This raises a more worrying question about Indonesia’s future under a probable Prabowo presidency. Will the world’s third-largest democracy continue the broadly successful rise of the post-Suharto period, or return to authoritarianism?</p>

在连续两次输给佐科维之后，普拉布沃错误地声称选举被窃取。2019年，他敦促支持者抗议选举结果，导致8人死亡。他还试图废除对地区领导人的直接选举，并表示印尼需要一个独裁领导人。这引出一个更令人担忧的问题：在可能的普拉布沃总统任期内，印尼的未来会继续印尼苏哈托之后时期广泛成功的崛起，还是会回归专制主义？


<p>Mr Prabowo owes his strong footing in the race to support from Jokowi, who is extremely popular. The president’s eldest son, Gibran Rakabuming, is Mr Prabowo’s running-mate. There are rumours of a deal between Mr Prabowo and Jokowi that would allow the outgoing president to wield influence behind the scenes after his term ends in October. Jokowi’s popularity is based in part on his <a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2024/02/08/the-false-promise-of-indonesias-economy">solid economic record</a>. During a decade in power he has presided over annual growth of 5%, liberalising reforms and a policy of resource nationalism that has helped develop a nickel-mining industry responsible for nearly half of global output. At the same time, he has weakened Indonesia’s nascent democratic institutions.</p>

普拉布沃先生在竞选中的稳固地位部分归功于佐科总统，后者极其受欢迎。总统的长子吉万·拉卡布米正是普拉布沃的竞选搭档。有传言称，普拉布沃先生与佐科之间存在协议，一旦佐科十月任期结束之后，可以继续在幕后施加影响。佐科总统受欢迎的部分原因在于他稳固的经济记录。十年执政期间，他见证了每年5%的增长率，推行了自由化改革，并实施了一项资源民族主义政策，这些措施促进了镍矿开采业的发展，该行业几乎占据了全球一半的产量。与此同时，他也削弱了印尼尚在萌芽阶段的民主机构。


<div><figure><span><img alt="" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/515/90/media-assets/image/20240210_ASM973.png"/></span></figure><p>Last October the country’s constitutional court, whose chief justice is Jokowi’s brother-in-law, delivered a ruling that in effect made the president’s 36-year-old son an exception to a rule that bars anyone under the age of 40 from running for president or vice-president. Jokowi is also alleged to have suborned the once independent anti-corruption commission. He now faces mounting criticism that he is interfering in the election. Rival campaign teams accuse state agencies of arbitrarily cancelling their rallies and intimidating Jokowi’s critics. Prominent Indonesian academics say the president is showing disregard for democracy. </p><p>If no candidate secures over 50% of the vote on February 14th, the election will go to a run-off in late June. That would allow the anti-Prabowo vote to unite, reducing the general’s chance of victory. Mr Prabowo’s two main opponents, Anies Baswedan, a former education minister and governor of Jakarta, and Ganjar Pranowo, a former governor of Central Java province, are both better qualified and more competent than he is. But their lacklustre campaigns have failed to convince many that a Prabowo presidency would be dangerous. According to<i> The Economist’</i>s aggregate of recent opinion polls, Mr Prabowo currently has around 53% of the vote. Mr Anies, who was sacked from Jokowi’s cabinet, has 20% and Mr Ganjar, the candidate of Indonesia’s largest political party, 19%. </p></div><h2>TikTok politics</h2>

抖音政治


<p>Indonesian elections tend to be decided by personality, not policy. Sure enough, Mr Prabowo’s team has revamped his image by posting short videos of the former general dancing goofily on TikTok, which has more subscribers in Indonesia than any country except America. Such gimmicks have helped divert younger voters, who mostly favour Mr Prabowo, from his unsavoury past. Many consider his military record a plus. Indonesia’s army is its most trusted public institution, surveys suggest.</p>

印尼选举往往由个人魅力而非政策决定。果然，普拉布沃先生的团队通过在印尼订阅用户超过任何其他国家（除美国）的TikTok上发布前将军笨拙跳舞的短视频，重塑了他的形象。这样的噱头有助于转移年轻选民的注意力，他们大多支持普拉布沃。许多人认为他的军旅记录是一种加分项。调查显示，印尼军队是其最值得信赖的公共机构。


<div><figure><span><img alt="" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/701/90/media-assets/image/20240210_ASC304.png"/></span></figure><p>It is unclear what Mr Prabowo would do with the power he has long sought. He has pledged to maintain Jokowi’s measures, including a nickel-centred industrial policy and a plan to relocate the capital from Jakarta to a site in the jungles of Borneo. But given his explosive temper and erratic behaviour, there is little reason to think Mr Prabowo would defer to Jokowi if elected. His other big ideas are mostly impractical or ruinously expensive. </p><p>Mr Prabowo has said double-digit growth is possible. His team says it aims to deliver 6-7% annual growth, in order to prevent Indonesia falling into the middle-income trap. Yet its economy has not grown at 7% since 1996, before the Asian financial crisis. And Mr Prabowo has given few details on how he would make it grow faster. His stump speeches are packed with fiery nationalism. “Some would have us sell raw materials to foreigners at cheap prices. I say: all our wealth must undergo domestic downstream processing!” he recently declared, referring to a policy that forces foreign commodity firms to add value to their products in Indonesia.</p><p>Mr Prabowo also says he wants to lessen Indonesia’s reliance on imported food. As defence minister, he has overseen the destruction of thousands of acres of forest in a failed attempt to boost rice production. He says he will give free milk and lunch to all Indonesian schoolchildren to curb the malnourishment that affects one in five. This programme will cost around $83m a day, estimates a spokesman for Mr Prabowo, Burhanuddin Abdullah, a former governor of Indonesia’s central bank. Mr Prabowo’s rivals argue that policies to reduce stunting should instead be aimed at pregnant mothers and newborn babies, not school-age children. No candidate has said anything of significance on foreign policy, beyond attempting to woo the 9m Indonesian voters who work overseas, many of them as maids, nannies and labourers on building sites.</p><p>The election has had a couple of positives. Five televised candidate debates were each watched by around 100m people. The vote count is expected to be credible. And across the world’s biggest archipelago, voters appear to cherish their suffrage. On a recent day on the campaign trail, tens of thousands travelled, sometimes for hours, on foot, by motorbike or by lorry to catch a glimpse of Mr Anies canvassing support on the island of Madura in east Java. He has held over 20 open forums across Indonesia, known as <i>Desak Anies</i> or “Challenge Anies”, in which voters are invited to fire impromptu questions at him.</p></div><p>Villagers in northern Sumatra questioned Mr Anies about land rights. Younger Indonesians wanted to know if he would legalise marijuana. This kind of campaigning is a break from the past, where politicians would pay dancers and musicians to entertain voters at rallies. It is also “a better way to compete”, says Mr Anies. It is rather hard to imagine this vision of a more serious Indonesian democracy being realised under Mr Prabowo. <span>■</span></p>

北苏门答腊的村民们向Anies先生询问土地权益问题。年轻的印尼人想知道他是否会合法化大麻。这种竞选活动打破了过去的政治模式，当时政治家会支付舞者和音乐家在集会上为选民表演。这也是Anies先生所说的“一种更好的竞争方式”。然而，很难想象在Prabowo先生领导下，这个更加严肃的印尼民主愿景能够得以实现。■
