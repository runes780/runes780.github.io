<div></div><p><span>“M</span><small>acky Sall</small>, Dictator!” chanted protesters on February 5th in Dakar, Senegal’s capital, as they dodged police officers firing tear gas and raged at their president. By late that evening it was getting harder to disagree. Riot police in masks and helmets marched into the National Assembly and dragged out about 30 opposition <small>MP</small>s. “It’s a coup d’état against the people,” shouted one <small>MP</small> before he was pulled away. They had been occupying the speaker’s platform in protest against a planned vote, held without any debate, to delay by almost ten months the presidential election scheduled for February 25th. Moments later the vote passed. Mr Sall will now stay in office far beyond his term, which was supposed to end on April 2nd. </p>

抗议者于2月5日在塞内加尔首都达喀尔举行抗议活动，其间躲闪着朝他们发射催泪瓦斯的警察。示威者痛斥自己的总统。那天深夜时分，反对之声愈发微弱。身着面罩和头盔的防暴警察进入国民议会，拽出约30名反对派议员。“这是一场针对人民的政变。”一位议员在被拖走前高喊道。他们一直占据着议长讲台的位置，抗议一项计划中的投票。该投票未经任何辩论便举行，目的是将原定于2月25日举行的总统选举推迟近10个月。几分钟后，投票获得通过。萨尔总统现在可以继续留任，远超原本预定的任期结束日期——4月2日。

Unlike many other countries in the region, it has avoided civil wars and coups, and has had a series of largely peaceful and democratic transitions of power. Never before has it delayed a presidential election. And in a region hit by a spate of coups, Mr Sall has played a leading role in the attempts by <small>ECOWAS</small>, the regional bloc, to push juntas back towards democracy. Yet his message has been undermined by a sharp decline in freedom in Senegal itself. Now its democracy is in grave danger.</p>

自那时以来，塞内加尔一直被视为非洲的明星：西非地区稳定、民主和经济增长的支柱。与其他许多该地区的国家不同，它避免了内战和政变，并经历了一系列主要和平与民主的权力交接。塞内加尔从未推迟过总统选举。在一个频繁发生政变的地区，萨勒先生在区域集团ECOWAS推动政变团体回归民主的努力中发挥了领导作用。

然而，他的信息被国内自由大幅下降的情况所削弱。如今，塞内加尔的民主正处在严重危险之中。


<div><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p>The vote followed a speech by Mr Sall on February 3rd in which he had simply called off the election and proposed a “national dialogue” to create the “conditions for a free, transparent and inclusive election”. Yet Mr Sall held such talks just months ago. </p>

投票行动发生在2月3日萨尔先生的演讲之后。在那次演讲中，他直接宣布取消选举，并提议举行“全国对话”，以创造“自由、透明和包容性选举”的条件。然而，几个月前萨尔先生就曾组织过这样的对话。


<p>Since then repression has ramped up alarmingly. One presidential candidate was arrested while protesting the next day. Several <small>MP</small>s who had opposed the delay attempted to campaign regardless. They too were arrested. Mobile-internet access was cut for 48 hours, motorbikes (popular with protesters) were banned, and a television station was shut down altogether. </p>

自那时以来，镇压力度惊人地升级。一位总统候选人抗议第二天的活动时被逮捕。几位曾反对延期的议员试图不管不顾继续竞选。他们也被捕。移动互联网接入被切断48小时，摩托车（抗议者常用）被禁止，一家电视台彻底停播。


<p>The constitutional crisis was triggered by accusations of alleged corruption in the Constitutional Council, the judicial body that determines whether candidates are eligible to run. Mr Sall justified postponing the election by saying time was needed to resolve the row between the council and some members of the assembly, which had already voted to open an inquiry. </p>

宪法危机是由对宪法委员会的腐败指控引发的。宪法委员会是决定候选人资格的司法机构。萨尔先生推迟选举的理由是，需要时间来解决宪法委员会与议会部分成员之间的争议。这部分成员已经投票决定启动调查。


<p>In January the council barred Ousmane Sonko, the leading opposition candidate, on the basis of his conviction for defamation in a case brought by a minister. In jail on separate charges of fomenting insurrection, Mr Sonko says the cases against him are politically motivated. The council also blocked Karim Wade, the son of a former president, from running. Mr Wade’s political party, which made the allegations of corruption against the council, has pushed for the inquiry and the delay. The council denies any wrongdoing. </p>

一月，委员会以一名反对派候选人此前因诽谤罪被判刑为由，禁止奥马尔·松戈参选。该案是由一位部长提起的。松戈先生目前因策划叛乱的指控而被关押。他表示对他提起的案件是出于政治动机。委员会还阻止了前总统儿子卡里姆·瓦德的竞选之路。瓦德的政治党派曾对委员会提出腐败指控，该党派一直推动调查和延迟。委员会否认有任何不当行为。


<p>What is Mr Sall up to? He claims to be defending democracy, warning that the dispute between judges and <small>MP</small>s “could seriously harm the credibility of the election”. Yet he is unconvincing as a democratic saviour—and not just because delaying an election and marching riot police into parliament is a curious way of defending democracy. </p>

萨尔先生到底在搞什么名堂？他自称是在保卫民主，警告说法官和议员之间的争执“可能会严重损害选举的可信度”。然而，作为一个民主救世主来说，他的论调并不令人信服——尤其是当推迟选举、让防暴警察进入议会成为所谓捍卫民主的方式时。

<div><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p>His government was first accused of politicising the justice system in 2019, when Mr Wade and another opposition figure were disqualified from running for president because of legal troubles. Mr Sall’s administration has also previously ignored the law, seemingly to keep Mr Sonko out of the race. (Mr Sall denies any wrongdoing.) Worse, since early 2021 at least 45 people have been killed in various protests backing Mr Sonko. </p>

他的政府在2019年首次遭到指控，称其将司法系统政治化。当时，瓦德先生和另一名反对派人物因为法律纠纷而被取消了总统候选资格。萨尔总统的行政部门也曾先前无视法律，似乎是为了防止桑科先生加入选举。（萨尔总统否认有任何不当行为。）更糟糕的是，自2021年初以来，至少有45人在支持桑科先生的各种抗议活动中丧生。


<p>Given all this, many fear Mr Sall, who had backed his prime minister, Amadou Ba, for president, has malign motives. One view is that he now believes Mr Ba will lose to Mr Sonko’s number two, who is running despite also being in jail—hence Mr Sall is delaying the election, perhaps to back another horse for the presidency.</p>

鉴于这些情况，许多人担心萨尔先生有恶意动机。其中一种观点是他现在认为巴先生将输掉选举，而索科总统的第二名候选人（尽管也在狱中）参选，因此萨尔先生在推迟选举，可能是为了支持另一位总统候选人。


<p>Another is that he wants to cling to power for himself, either by delaying the poll again, or by going back on his word not to run for a third term. This would seem to be in breach of the constitution’s two-term limit, but Mr Sall maintains that he can run legally. The president had previously flirted with standing again before belatedly ruling it out. But he can be fickle—he postponed the election just days after pledging to stick to the original timetable.</p>

另一点是他想自私地保住权力，要么再次推迟选举，要么违背自己不寻求第三任期的承诺。这似乎违反了宪法对任期限制的规定，但萨尔总统坚称他可以合法竞选。

总统先前曾考虑再次参选，但在最后一刻排除了这个可能性。但他可能会反复无常——他在承诺坚持原定时间表后仅仅几天就推迟了选举。


<p>Since the chaos in the National Assembly there have not been any large protests, perhaps because the police are out in force and up to 1,000 opposition members and activists have been arrested. Yet the fight is not over. There is talk of a general strike, influential religious bodies have denounced Mr Sall’s move, and the opposition is hatching plans for protests it hopes the police will find harder to stop. </p>

自国家议会的混乱以来，没有发生过大规模抗议活动，可能是因为警察出动频繁，多达1000名反对派成员和活动人士被逮捕。然而斗争并未结束。有人谈论全面罢工，有影响力的宗教团体谴责萨尔先生的举动，反对派正在策划希望警方更难阻止的抗议活动。


<p>The American government says that the vote to delay “cannot be considered legitimate”. Several candidates are challenging it at the Constitutional Council. They ought to have a strong case, since the constitution says that the duration of the president’s mandate cannot be amended. But since the council has been accused of impropriety, a ruling in either direction is unlikely to resolve the crisis. </p>

美国政府声称，推迟投票“不能被视为合法”。几位候选人已向宪法委员会提出异议。他们本应有强有力的论点，因为宪法规定总统任期的长度不得修改。然而，考虑到宪法委员会被指责行为不端，无论裁决方向如何，都不太可能解决当前危机。


<p>“We are in a situation of total uncertainty,” says Alioune Tine, a human-rights activist in Senegal. “This jump into the unknown can have unexpected consequences—like the army taking power.” <span>■</span></p>

“我们正处在一个极度不确定的情况中。”塞内加尔的人权活动家奥利昂涅·提涅说道。“这种对未知的突然跃进可能会产生意想不到的后果——就像军队接管政权一样。”■
