<div></div><p><span>I</span><small>t was</small> <small>a</small> year ago that the woman who asked to be referred to as Xue Li entered the minefield, although she did not know it at the time. It was only when a mine detonated that she realised the risk she had been running—and by then it was too late.</p>

一年前，那位被要求以薛丽之名相告的女性踏入了雷区——尽管当时她并未意识到这一点。直到一颗地雷爆炸，她才意识到自己所面临的危险——然而为时已晚。

In Ms Xue’s case, the blast came from a wealth-management product that had promised an annual return of about 8%. It had been recommended by a friend and was sold by Hywin, a big firm based in Shanghai but listed in both Hong Kong and New York. She put in 300,000 yuan ($42,000) last February and a further 500,000 a few months later. In December, however, it became clear that the firm was struggling to meet its obligations. It is uncertain how much of her original investment, if any, Ms Xue will ever see again. </p>

原文中提到的是一个投资失败的情况，可以将其翻译为：

中国称之为“地雷爆炸”的不良投资。在薛女士的案例中，爆炸源于一款承诺年化回报大约8%的财富管理产品。它是由朋友推荐，并由总部位于上海但在香港和纽约都上市的大公司Hywin销售的。去年二月，她投入了300万元人民币（约42万美元），几个月后又追加了500万元。然而，在十二月，很明显这家公司正努力履行其义务。目前尚不确定薛女士能否再次看到她的原始投资（如果有的话）。


<p>Across China hundreds of thousands of the well-to-do have suffered landmine injuries in recent months. Zhongzhi, an investment firm which went bust in December, owes its 150,000 clients $36bn. And explosions are not confined to wealth-management firms. By far the most common investment in China is property, and property values have been falling for almost three years. The stockmarket, too, is sliding: the Shanghai Composite, one of the most prominent indices, has dropped by over 20% since its peak in 2021. And whereas the government has in the past stepped in to help investors hit by plunging asset prices, this time it shows little inclination for a bail-out. Ms Xue will have to try to stanch the bleeding on her own.</p>

过去几个月，中国各地数十万富裕阶层人士遭受了地雷伤害。12月破产的投资公司中植集团欠其150万客户的360亿元人民币。爆炸不仅仅局限于财富管理公司。在中国，最常见的投资是房地产，而房地产价格已经下跌近三年。股市也在下滑：上海综合指数是最具代表性的指数之一，自2021年的峰值以来已经下跌超过20%。以往政府会介入帮助资产价格暴跌导致投资者受损的情况。但这一次，政府表现出不愿意进行救援的态度。薛女士将不得不独自尝试止血。


<p>China publishes almost no official data about the distribution of wealth, perhaps for fear of revealing just how unequal it is. But <i>The Economist</i> has analysed nationwide surveys from 2018 and 2020 that asked participants about their income and investments, weighting the responses to reflect China’s demography. That has yielded a rough breakdown of who owns most of the financial assets that are losing value so fast, and so allowed us to infer what the swooning markets might mean for China’s economy and society.</p>

中国几乎不发布关于财富分配的官方数据，可能是因为担心暴露其不平等程度。然而，《经济学人》分析了2018年和2020年的全国范围调查数据，这些调查询问参与者收入和投资情况，并根据中国的人口结构对响应进行加权。这为我们粗略地了解谁拥有大部分金融资产（这些资产价值正在快速缩水）提供了依据，因此我们可以推断市场大幅下跌可能对中国经济和社会意味着什么。


<h2>Year of the drubbing</h2>

痛打之年


<p>A huge share of the country’s wealth, it turns out, is in the hands of people like Ms Xue. The drubbing the markets have been giving them, and the government’s apparent indifference, is reshaping their investment preferences, in all likelihood for years to come. That, in turn, will impede the authorities’ plans to develop the financial system and thus slow China’s future growth. Ms Xue and investors like her will suffer the most, but China’s economy will also end up scarred by the detonations. </p>

原来，中国相当可观的财富掌握在了像徐女士这样的手里。市场对她们的无情打压以及政府看似漠不关心的态度，正悄然重塑她们的投资偏好——很可能未来多年都会如此。而这反过来又会妨碍当局发展金融体系的计划，从而放缓中国的未来增长。

徐女士和她这样的投资者将遭受最大损失，但中国经济也将因这些爆炸而留下永久的伤痕。


<div><figure><span><img alt="" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/667/90/media-assets/image/20240210_FBC330.png"/></span></figure><p>The survey data suggest that about 50% of China’s wealth is in the hands of the 113m or so people with a net worth of 1m-10m yuan. This cohort—just 8% of the population—has even more influence over financial markets than their wealth would suggest. They own 64% of all publicly traded shares, for instance, and 61% of investment funds (see chart 1).</p><p>The group are the main beneficiaries of China’s 40-odd years of booming growth. Born in the 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s, they were some of the first to return to university after schools were closed during the Cultural Revolution. They were the first group to start small, private businesses. When the Shanghai stock exchange opened in 1990, they were among the first retail investors on the scene. They also propelled China’s property market since the first mortgage was issued by a state bank in 1986. Many will have cashed in on the privatisation of housing in the 1990s, buying flats for meagre sums that are now worth a fortune. They have experienced a miraculous shift in living standards over their working lives, from communal kitchens to holiday homes. Deng Xiaoping declared in the late 1970s that China would reject Maoism and “let some people get rich first”, and these are the people who did. </p><p>Ms Xue appears to be a typical member of the “got-rich-first” group. She is a Beijinger in her late 40s, eyeing an early retirement after 25 years in advertising. She has saved and invested widely. In addition to the detonated wealth-management product, she owns a residential investment property and some commercial property that she rents out. About 20% of her savings are in the stockmarket. All of these investments are now losing value. It is not obvious where to turn. China’s strict capital controls make it difficult and prohibitively expensive to move money abroad; the closest she has come to that is an insurance policy from Macau, a “special administrative region” with different financial regulations and its own currency. Ms Xue’s only other form of diversification has been to stash away some gold.</p><p>For China’s wealthy, the present market turmoil is unprecedented and disorienting. Property prices had risen steadily for decades, with only a tiny blip in 2008. Although the stockmarket has been more volatile, the state has typically intervened to prevent big routs. Investors in more esoteric wealth-management products have also benefited from bail-outs when things went wrong, while receiving high yields in the meantime. A recent survey of affluent Chinese by Charles Schwab, an American asset manager, found that more than half expected 20-40% annual returns.</p></div><h2>Dragon mire</h2>

龙沼泽地


<p>Such expectations are looking ever less plausible. During Xi Jinping’s first term as China’s leader, in 2013-18, the average annual growth in personal income from investments was 10.8%. That fell during Mr Xi’s second term to 7%. Over the past two years it has sunk below 5%.</p>

这种预期的合理性正日益减弱。在习近平主席2013-2018年任内，中国个人投资收入的平均年度增长率是10.8%。这一增速在中国第二任期内（即2018至今）下滑至7%。在过去两年中，这一增速已经下降到5%以下。


<p>In part, this reflects Mr Xi’s determination to prevent bubbles and thus make the financial system more stable. To that end, he has tried to dispel the assumption that the state will come to the rescue of any struggling financial firm. In 2018, for example, he instigated a crackdown on online-lending platforms, wiping out an industry with 1trn yuan in outstanding loans. That was part of a broader campaign to restrict lending outside banks, which has shrunk by more than half since 2016.</p>

这部分反映了习主席的决心，要防止泡沫并因此使金融体系更加稳定。为此，他试图消除这样的假设：任何陷入困境的金融机构都指望政府救援。例如，2018年，他发起了一场针对线上贷款平台的大规模打击行动，一举消灭了一个拥有1万亿元逾期贷款的行业。这是更广泛的遏制银行系统以外放贷努力的一部分，自2016年以来，这部分放贷已经减少了超过一半。


<div><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p>The authorities still seem keen to shield the poor from turmoil in the financial system. This year, for instance, the central government will attempt to merge more than 2,000 rural banks with more than $6trn in assets, to strengthen institutions catering mainly to people on the lowest rung of China’s economic ladder. But the rich are a different story. When several small banks collapsed in 2022, deposits in excess of 500,000 yuan were not reimbursed by the state. By the same token, as property developers have gone bust the state has dragged its feet about rescuing those who paid for apartments that were never built, many of whom are relatively affluent. Wealthier investors, the logic runs, can afford to absorb the losses and should understand the risks.</p>

当局似乎仍热衷于保护穷人免受金融体系动荡的影响。例如，今年中央政府将试图合并超过2000家农村银行，这些银行资产超过6万亿美元，目的是加强主要服务于中国经济阶梯最低层人群的金融机构。但富人则是另一回事了。当2022年几家中小银行倒闭时，存款超过500万元人民币的部分并没有得到国家的赔偿。同样地，随着房地产开发商破产，政府在拯救那些为从未建成的公寓支付款项的人方面行动迟缓，其中许多人相对富裕。按照这种逻辑，更富有的投资者有能力吸收损失，并应理解风险所在。


<p>But the risks are often opaque, and different investments more closely related than they at first appear. A search for “landmine investment” on Chinese social media reveals endless posts about trusts and other wealth-management products. These typically funnel cash from China’s rich to risky borrowers willing to pay high interest rates. The trust industry alone has raised $2.9trn from 1.3m people and companies. About 30% of its loans are used to buy bonds, equities and investment funds. Another quarter is lending to conventional businesses. More than 7% has gone to property developers, almost all of whom are on the ropes.</p>

但风险常常看似透明，而不同的投资比乍看之下更为紧密相连。在中国社交媒体上搜索“地雷投资”，你会发现有关信托和其他财富管理产品的无穷无尽的帖子。这些通常将中国的富人手中的现金引导到愿意支付高利率的高风险借款人手中。仅信托行业就从130万人和公司筹集了2.9万亿美元。大约30%的贷款用于购买债券、股票和投资基金。另一季度则是向传统企业发放贷款。超过7%的资金流向房地产开发商，几乎所有人都陷入了困境。


<p>Wang Yong’s parents, who are got-rich-first types, were assured they were not investing in property when they bought a trust product last year. The family lives in a prosperous coastal port city. Mr Wang’s father has long invested in stocks. His mother in recent years has dabbled in wealth-management products, often taking the recommendations of an adviser at an asset-management company. Last year she went big, buying a 3m yuan trust product issued by a state-owned industrial enterprise. She later discovered that her money had been lent to a property developer that had defaulted. The state firm said the problem would be resolved in 60 days. That deadline came and went in early January. That’s when Mr Wang (a pseudonym) began posting complaints on social media. </p>

王勇（化名）的父母都是先富起来的人，去年他们购买了一款信托产品时，并没有意识到这是在投资房地产。他们一家住在一个繁荣的沿海港口城市。

王先生的父亲长期以来一直在股市投资。他的母亲近年来也开始涉足财富管理产品，经常听从资产管理公司顾问的建议。去年，她加大了投入，购买了一款价值300万元的信托产品，该产品由一家国有企业工业企业发行。

后来她发现，自己的资金被借给了一个违约的房地产开发商。国有企业表示，问题将在60天内解决。这个期限在1月初到期后又过去了。

就在那时，王勇开始在社交媒体上发布投诉。


<div><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p>Tens of thousands are doing the same. Trust defaults are rising at an alarming rate. The product Mr Wang bought was issued by a firm with about 740bn yuan ($100bn) in assets. Many other trust firms are expected to miss payments in the coming months. The government has so far refused to bail them out. Most clients have no way to recoup their money. Lawyers tend to advise that lawsuits are futile.</p>

成千上万的人正在做同样的事情。信任违约正以前所未有的速度上升。王先生购买的产品由一家资产约为7400亿元人民币（合1万亿美元）的公司发行。预计未来几个月，许多其他信托公司将无法按时支付。到目前为止，政府已拒绝为其提供救助。大多数客户没有办法追回他们的钱。律师往往建议打官司是徒劳的。


<p>Property has also become a landmine for many investors. For years Chinese media celebrated the “explosive expansion” of urban apartment prices and urged people to cash in. Ms Xu, a finance executive in her 50s who did not want her full name published, made sure that she did. She moved to Shanghai 20 years ago but often returns to her hometown inland, where she bought two investment flats. (Her parents live in one of them.) By 2021 their value had more than doubled. Last year, as the downturn deepened, she put both flats on the market in the hope of realising some gains before prices fell further. But she has not been able to sell them. Developers have cut the prices of new flats in her city by more than 10%. Potential buyers are holding back in expectation of further drops. She fears all her gains will be wiped out.</p>

对于许多投资者来说，房产也成为了地雷。多年来，中国媒体不断赞扬城市公寓价格的“爆炸性增长”，并敦促人们趁机获利。一位名叫徐（音译）的五十多岁财务高管不愿透露全名，但她确实在这件事情上有所行动。她20年前搬到了上海，但经常返回内陆的家乡，在那里购买了两套投资性质的公寓。（她的父母住在其中一套里。）到2021年，这两套公寓的价值已经超过了原来的两倍多。去年，随着衰退加剧，她将这两套公寓投放市场，希望能在房价进一步下跌之前实现部分收益。但是，她至今未能成功出售这两套房产。在她的城市中，开发商已经将其新开发的公寓价格降低了超过10%。潜在买家们都在持币待购，期待价格能够进一步下跌。她担心自己所有的收益都将被抹去。


<p>Half of China’s housing wealth belongs to the got-rich-first. There are no nationwide data on house prices and the official figures for individual cities seem to understate falling prices. The government’s numbers claim that prices have barely budged in Shanghai. Local economists, in contrast, reckon they have crashed by 20-30% in some central districts and could fall further in 2024. People in smaller cities talk of 30-40% “discounts” on new flats. </p>

中国的房屋财富有一半属于最先富起来的人。全国范围内没有关于房价的全国数据，各个城市的官方数据似乎低估了房价下跌的程度。政府的数据声称上海的房价几乎没有变化。相反，当地经济学家估计，在一些中心区域，房价已经下跌20-30%，在未来2024年可能会进一步下滑。小城市的人们谈论新房源上可高达30-40%的“折扣”。


<p>Chinese spent about 16.3trn yuan buying homes in 2021. Analysts believe that up until that year about 30% of residential property was purchased as an investment, rather than to live in. That means punters pumped some 5trn yuan into investment properties at the top of the market and will have lost a big part of their savings.</p>

2021年，中国人在购房上花费约16.3万亿元。分析师认为，在那之前大约有30%的住宅物业是以投资为目的购买的，而不是为了居住。这意味着投资者在市场顶部将大约5万亿元的资金注入了投资性房产，而现在他们将失去很大一部分存款。


<figure><span><img alt="" height="720" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/media-assets/image/20240210_FBD002.jpg" width="1280"/></span></figure><p>Again, the government does not seem too concerned. The central bank declined to cut rates in January, despite months of deflation. The authorities have long wanted to quell speculation in property and prevent bubbles forming. They worry that too much of China’s household wealth—some 80%—is concentrated in housing, compared with about 30% in America, for example. There is little systemic risk: banks are well capitalised and mortgages form a relatively small share of their assets. Local governments, meanwhile, see a chance to acquire lots of apartments on the cheap, to be used as low-income housing.</p>

中国政府似乎并未过分担忧。1月份，尽管经历了数月的通缩，但中央银行仍拒绝降息。当局长期以来一直希望平抑房地产投机，防止泡沫形成。他们担心中国家庭财富的大部分——约80%——都集中在住房上，而相比之下，例如在美国，这一比例约为30%。总体风险并不大：银行资本充足，抵押贷款在其资产中所占的比例相对较小。同时，地方政府看到了一个机会，以低价收购大量的公寓，用于作为低收入住房使用。


<p>But this blasé view disregards the gloom that is spreading fast among the got-rich-first. On top of everything else, many are seeing their wages fall. About a third of white-collar workers say their salaries were cut last year, the highest proportion for several years, according to Zhaopin, a job-search firm. Many senior bankers’ pay has been slashed by 30%, one claims, as part of Mr Xi’s push to rid the financial industry of Western-style extravagance. Wage growth in the private sector slowed to just 3.7% in 2022, down from double digits just a few years ago, the National Bureau of Statistics reports.</p>

然而，这种冷漠的观点忽略了最先致富的那一部分人中日益快速蔓延的悲观情绪。除此之外，许多人发现自己的工资在下降。据招聘公司智联招聘(Zhaopin)的数据，大约三分之一的白领表示去年他们的薪水被削减了，这是几年来的最高比例。

许多高级银行家的薪酬被砍掉了30%，有人声称，这作为习近平主席推动金融业摆脱西方式奢华的努力的一部分。

私人部门的工资增长放缓至2022年的仅3.7%，低于几年前双位数的增长，国家统计局(National Bureau of Statistics)报告指出。


<div><div><div id="econ-3"></div></div></div><p>Financial reversals among the rich tend to reverberate through the economy. In an article entitled “My middle-class dream died in wealth management”, published late last year in a local newspaper, a 40-year-old woman named Zhou Ning described how she had lost millions of yuan to landmines. She explained how she has gone from holidaying in Europe and America to asking relatives for money. She has been forced to sell her luxury handbags and find part-time work. She can no longer pay for her mother-in-law’s cancer treatment. She has moved her child from a fancy international kindergarten to one with nearly triple the number of pupils.</p>

富人的财务逆转往往会通过经济产生回响。在去年年底当地报纸上发表的一篇文章《我的中产阶级梦想死于财富管理》中，一位名叫周宁的40岁女性描述了她是如何损失数百万人民币陷入土地雷的困境。她解释了自己是如何从欧洲和美洲度假到向亲戚借钱的转变。她被迫出售她的豪华手袋，并找了一份兼职工作。她再也负担不起婆婆的癌症治疗费用。她把孩子从一所高档国际幼儿园转到了学生数量接近三倍的地方。


<p>As their income declines and their assets atrophy, the got-rich-first are becoming more cautious about spending. This “negative wealth effect” is hurting the economy. Oxford Economics, a research firm, estimates that household savings jumped to 32.4% of disposable income in the last quarter of 2023. Excess savings that could be used to consume or invest probably hit around 4trn yuan, or 3.2% of <small>GDP</small>.</p>

随着他们的收入下降，资产缩水，“先富起来的人”在消费上变得更加谨慎。这种“负财富效应”正在拖累经济。

研究机构 Oxford Economics 预测，在2023年最后一个季度，家庭储蓄率猛增至可支配收入的32.4%。过剩的储蓄可能达到约4万亿元人民币（占GDP的3.2%）。


<div><figure><span><img alt="" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/1214/90/media-assets/image/20240210_FBC319.png"/></span></figure><p>As they become more cautious, the got-rich-first are reshaping China’s markets. An executive at one of China’s biggest asset-management firms says the collapse of Zhongzhi has been catastrophic for his industry. Clients used to grill him about the returns products would earn, he says; “Now they want proof we’re not a scam.” Mutual funds, which invest in stocks and are hard to redeem, saw their smallest inflows in a decade last year. Money-market funds, which can be sold instantly, grew from 8.1trn yuan in 2020 to 12.3trn in July (see chart 2).</p><p>It is into safe and liquid assets that China’s wealth is moving like never before, says Philip Leung of Bain, a consulting firm. Fixed-term deposits at banks, one of the safest investments available, grew faster last year than at any point since they were introduced in 2015. By the same token, the few funds that are allowed to invest abroad grew fourfold to 400bn yuan in assets under management between 2020 and last July. And sales of insurance policies like Ms Xue’s reportedly soared last year in Macau and Hong Kong, another special administrative region with its own currency and financial regulation.</p><p>All this will have a baleful effect on the financial system and the broader economy. Retail investors’ hitherto growing interest in stocks, bonds and investment funds, which the government had hoped would reduce Chinese savers’ fixation with property, has reversed. In the long run, that will reduce the flow of capital to business. The got-rich-first will also be more cautious about investing in their own businesses. Li Wei of Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business (<small>CKGSB</small>) in Beijing says entrepreneurs born in the 1960s and 1970s have been the driving force of company formation and wealth creation for decades. But a survey of business confidence conducted by <small>CKGSB</small> has found declining expectations for profits for seven consecutive months—a first in the survey’s 12-year history, excluding the pandemic. </p><p>The landmines are also creating protesters among a previously apolitical group. The got-rich-first tended to look favourably on the government, which helped them to so massively improve their lot over the years. But Ms Xue and Mr Wang, at least, have been transformed into activists, hoping to bring attention to their causes. After posting a video on social media about her landmine injury, Ms Xue began receiving messages from people in different cities who had lost money on the same product. She has urged them to go to the police. She has also led small groups to the offices of Hywin in Beijing. Mr Wang, too, has linked up with fellow investors. They have visited the bank branches in their cities to complain. This appears to be a growing trend among wealthy Chinese who have experienced financial losses. <i>The Economist</i> has spoken to several well-off investors over the past two years who have taken to the streets and even clashed with police in the hopes of spurring the authorities to action.</p></div><p>None of these efforts has been successful. Ms Xue’s visits to the police have resulted only in a warning not to “incite” others to complain. Mr Xi is keen to make financial markets more stable, but he does not want the Communist Party to be blamed when they malfunction. Protesters are usually safe if they stick to complaining about deadbeat firms, but if their actions could be construed as criticism of the government, they risk detention. </p>

这些努力均未能奏效。薛女士到警察局抗议，结果只换来警告，不得“煽动”他人投诉。习先生热衷于让金融市场更加稳定，但他不希望共产党在金融体系失灵时受到责备。抗议者通常只要专注于抱怨不良企业，就能保证安全；但如果他们的行为可以被解读为批评政府，那么他们就有可能被捕。


<h2>Dragon’s denigrators</h2>

龙的诋毁者


<p>Even if most got-rich-first keep quiet, however, the current turmoil is unwinding decades of goodwill between the government and its most productive citizens. Whereas previously China’s thriving strivers and the authorities appeared to be on the same side, often in contrast to pampered young people, the state now appears indifferent if not hostile to the problems of the well-to-do. The got-rich-first, says an investment manager, “are just starting to realise that they have become the enemy”. That is a shift that will have grim consequences not just for them, but for all of China. <span>■</span></p>

即便是大多数先富起来的人选择保持沉默，但当前的风波正在瓦解政府与最富有公民之间数十年的良好关系。过去，中国的成功奋斗者和当局似乎站在同一阵线，常常与被宠溺的年轻人形成对比。然而现在，国家对富裕阶层的问题表现出冷漠甚至敌意的态度。

一位投资经理说：“先富起来的人们才刚刚开始意识到他们已经成为敌人。”这是一个转变，不仅对他们自身造成严峻后果，而且对中国整体也产生了影响。■
