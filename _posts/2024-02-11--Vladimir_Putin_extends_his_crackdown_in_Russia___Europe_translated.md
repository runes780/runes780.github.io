<div></div><p><span>O</span><small>n January 25th</small> a Russian court sentenced Igor Girkin, a former officer of the <small>FSB</small>, Russia’s main security service, to four years in a penal colony for the crime of “public incitement of extremist activity”. His arrest last July, days after he had criticised Vladimir Putin’s wartime decisions and called the Russian president a “cowardly mediocrity” on social media, has sent shockwaves through Russia’s active community of pro-war nationalists, many of whom deem him a hero.</p>

1月25日，俄罗斯法庭判处前FSB（俄罗斯主要安全服务机构）军官伊戈尔·吉尔金因“公开煽动极端主义活动”罪名在劳改营服刑四年。去年7月，就在他批评了弗拉基米尔·普京的战时决策，并在社交媒体上称俄罗斯总统为“懦弱的平庸之辈”后的几天，他的被捕震动了俄罗斯亲战民族主义活跃群体中的许多人，他们中的许多人视其为英雄。

He remains a strong supporter of both the war and Russia’s resurgent national project, notwithstanding running afoul of the Kremlin. The case has heralded a shift in Kremlin prison policy, which now not merely punishes critics of the war but also seeks to rein in the excesses of troublesome supporters. </p>

吉尔金先生的声誉建立在他军事情报生涯的基础上；化名斯特列洛夫（“射手”），他在2014年克里米亚并吞以及乌克兰东部顿巴斯地区初期叛乱组织中发挥了关键作用。他至今仍是战争和俄罗斯日益复苏的国家项目坚定的支持者，尽管他曾与克里姆林宫发生冲突。这起案件预示了克里姆林宫监狱政策的一个转变，现在不仅惩罚战争批评者，还试图控制麻烦支持者的过激行为。


<aside><p><i>Read more of our recent coverage of the <a href="https://www.economist.com/ukraine-crisis">Ukraine war</a></i></p></aside><p>Politically motivated cases in Russia have long resulted in draconian prison sentences, but the motivations for such prosecution have shifted with time. In the 2000s cases were brought against prominent business figures like Mikhail Khodorkovsky, an oligarch, and Sergei Magnitsky, a tax adviser who later died violently while in custody. In the 2010s political prisoners tended to be involved in protest movements, as was the case with the band Pussy Riot and with the house arrest in 2014 of Alexei Navalny, Russia’s most prominent opposition leader. </p>

俄罗斯由政治动机引发的案件长期以来导致了严厉的监禁判决。然而，这类起诉背后的动力随着时间的推移而发生了变化。在21世纪初，像米哈伊尔·霍多罗夫斯基（一位寡头）和谢尔盖·马格尼茨基（一名税务顾问，后来死于非命，当时他被拘捕）这样的知名商界人物成为被告目标。到了2010年代，政治犯往往与抗议活动有关联，例如女子乐队“ Pussy Riot”案以及俄罗斯最著名的反对派领袖阿列克谢·纳瓦尔尼（Alexei Navalny）在2014年被软禁的案例。


<div><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p>Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, however, the policy shifted again and Russia’s many prisons started to be used as an instrument for punishing opponents of the war. Mr Navalny, who has been held in custody since 2021, has received two additional sentences since the invasion began: first for nine years and then for another 19.</p>

然而，在2022年2月俄罗斯入侵乌克兰后，政策再次转变。俄罗斯的众多监狱开始被用作惩罚战争对手的工具。

自2021年以来一直被拘留的纳瓦尔尼先生，在入侵开始以来又收到了两个额外判决：首先被判处九年，随后又被判处额外的十九年。


<p>Punishment even against grassroots activists has veered into the absurd. One example is the seven-year sentence imposed in mid-November on Sasha Skochilenko, an artist who replaced grocery-store price tags with criticisms of the Russian army and the war effort. Last summer Olga Smirnova, an activist, was sentenced to six years in jail in connection with seven war-related posts she had made on Vkontakte, a Russian social-media platform. </p>

对包括草根活动人士在内的惩罚甚至已经变得荒谬。一个例子是，11月中旬，艺术家萨沙·斯科奇连科被判七年徒刑。他替换食品店价格标签的行为批评了俄罗斯军队和战争努力。去年夏天，活动人士奥尔加·斯米尔诺娃因在社交平台VKontakte上发布与七次战争相关的帖子，被判处六年监禁。


<p>Cases such as these are launched selectively, and to set an example, says Sergey Troshin, a St Petersburg municipal councillor who has expressed public support for both Ms Smirnova and Ms Skochilenko. “The task the state set for itself was to take a few people and publicly hand them large sentences,” he said. “You can think of this as ‘precision repression’, and it makes people scared enough to halt their activism.” </p>

这些案件是精心挑选并公开树立榜样的，”圣彼得堡市议员谢尔盖·特罗申（Sergey Troshin）说。他表达了对斯米尔诺娃女士和斯科奇连科女士的公共支持。“国家给自己设定的任务是，选择几个人，在公开场合对他们处以严厉的判决。”他说，“你可以把这看作‘精准镇压’，它足以让人们对自己的行动感到害怕，从而停止。”


<p>According to <small>OVD</small>-Info, a human-rights monitor, approximately 160 Russians have been imprisoned and over 850 have been prosecuted for anti-war activities since the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. </p>

根据人权监督组织OVD-Info的数据，自2022年2月乌克兰全面入侵以来，大约有160名俄罗斯人因反战活动被监禁，超过850人受到了起诉。


<p>The prison system has also been used as a reward for loyalty as much as a punishment for defiance. Prisoners, many of whom had been convicted for multiple, violent crimes, have walked free with full pardons after serving in the Russian army in Ukraine for as little as six months. This has been framed in state-run media outlets and friendly social media as a reward for loyalty to a new national project centred on resistance to the West, the promotion of a multipolar world and Russia’s continuing influence in the “near abroad”. </p>

监狱系统也被用作奖赏，奖励对新国家项目——以抵抗西方为中心、促进多极世界以及俄罗斯在“近邻”地区持续影响力的项目——的忠诚。在官方媒体和友好的社交媒体上，这种释放常常被包装成因为参与乌克兰内战，在俄罗斯军队中服役仅仅六个月而获得的忠诚奖励。


<div><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p>However, a recent investigation conducted by <small>BBC </small>Russia uncovered a shift in policy. In an effort to curb local resentment, and probably to distance the president from what has proved to be a controversial policy during the runup to the presidential elections next month, ex-convict veterans are now required to serve until the war’s end in return for probation rather than a pardon. Exoneration may only be received in cases when soldiers reach the military’s age limit, earn a special commendation or are maimed in combat, described as “health loss”. <span>■</span></p>

然而，最近BBC俄国进行的一项调查揭示了政策的转变。为了抑制当地民众的反感——很可能也是为了使总统远离那些在即将举行的下个月总统选举中被证明具有争议性的政策——现在要求曾经是囚犯的老兵们必须服完直至战争结束的期限，以获得缓刑而不是赦免。只有在士兵达到军队年龄限制、获得特殊嘉奖或在战斗中受伤（被称为“健康损失”）的情况下，才可能得到赦免。■
