<div></div><p><span>O</span><small>n January 25th</small> a Russian court sentenced Igor Girkin, a former officer of the <small>FSB</small>, Russia’s main security service, to four years in a penal colony for the crime of “public incitement of extremist activity”. His arrest last July, days after he had criticised Vladimir Putin’s wartime decisions and called the Russian president a “cowardly mediocrity” on social media, has sent shockwaves through Russia’s active community of pro-war nationalists, many of whom deem him a hero.</p>

1月25日，俄罗斯一家法院判处前FSB（俄罗斯主要安全服务机构）军官伊戈尔·吉尔金因“公开煽动极端主义活动”罪名，在监狱服刑四年。去年7月，就在他批评弗拉基米尔·普京在战争中的决策，并在社交媒体上称俄罗斯总统为“胆小平庸之辈”后的几天，他的被捕震惊了俄罗斯积极的亲战民族主义者群体，许多人认为他是英雄。

He remains a strong supporter of both the war and Russia’s resurgent national project, notwithstanding running afoul of the Kremlin. The case has heralded a shift in Kremlin prison policy, which now not merely punishes critics of the war but also seeks to rein in the excesses of troublesome supporters. </p>

格林kin先生的名声建立在他军政生涯的基础之上；在代号“斯特列尔科夫”（意为“神射手”）的秘密行动中，他证明了自己是2014年克里米亚被吞并以及乌克兰东部顿巴斯地区叛乱组织初期构建中的关键人物。尽管曾触怒克里姆林宫，但他至今仍是这场战争和俄罗斯重新崛起的民族项目坚定的支持者。

这场案件预示了克里姆林宫监狱政策的一个转变，现在不仅仅是惩罚对战争持批评态度的人，而且还会试图约束那些麻烦制造者的过激行为。


<aside><p><i>Read more of our recent coverage of the <a href="https://www.economist.com/ukraine-crisis">Ukraine war</a></i></p></aside><p>Politically motivated cases in Russia have long resulted in draconian prison sentences, but the motivations for such prosecution have shifted with time. In the 2000s cases were brought against prominent business figures like Mikhail Khodorkovsky, an oligarch, and Sergei Magnitsky, a tax adviser who later died violently while in custody. In the 2010s political prisoners tended to be involved in protest movements, as was the case with the band Pussy Riot and with the house arrest in 2014 of Alexei Navalny, Russia’s most prominent opposition leader. </p>

俄罗斯的政治案件长期以来导致严厉的监禁判决，但这种起诉背后的原因随着时间的推移而发生了变化。在21世纪初，针对像米哈伊尔·霍多尔科夫斯基这样的寡头和税务顾问谢尔盖·马格尼茨基（他后来在拘留中暴力死亡）等知名商业人士提出了诉讼案件。在21世纪10年代，政治犯往往与抗议运动有关，例如朋克摇滚乐队Pussy Riot，以及俄罗斯最著名反对派领袖阿列克谢·纳瓦尔ny2014年被软禁的情况就是这样。


<div><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p>Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, however, the policy shifted again and Russia’s many prisons started to be used as an instrument for punishing opponents of the war. Mr Navalny, who has been held in custody since 2021, has received two additional sentences since the invasion began: first for nine years and then for another 19.</p>

然而，在2022年2月俄罗斯入侵乌克兰后，政策再次转变。俄罗斯众多监狱开始被用作惩罚战争反对者的工具。

自2021年起被拘留的 Navalny先生，在入侵开始以来又收到了两个额外判决：首先被判为9年，随后又加刑19年。


<p>Punishment even against grassroots activists has veered into the absurd. One example is the seven-year sentence imposed in mid-November on Sasha Skochilenko, an artist who replaced grocery-store price tags with criticisms of the Russian army and the war effort. Last summer Olga Smirnova, an activist, was sentenced to six years in jail in connection with seven war-related posts she had made on Vkontakte, a Russian social-media platform. </p>

即便对基层活动人士的惩罚也变得荒谬起来。一个例子是，11月中旬，艺术家萨沙·斯科奇列诺夫（Sasha Skochilenko）因批评俄罗斯军队和战争努力，而将杂货店的价格标签替换为批评言论，被判处七年徒刑。去年夏天，活动人士奥尔加·斯米尔诺娃（Olga Smirnova）因在VKontakte（一家俄罗斯社交媒体平台）上发布了七条与战争相关的内容，而被判六年监禁。


<p>Cases such as these are launched selectively, and to set an example, says Sergey Troshin, a St Petersburg municipal councillor who has expressed public support for both Ms Smirnova and Ms Skochilenko. “The task the state set for itself was to take a few people and publicly hand them large sentences,” he said. “You can think of this as ‘precision repression’, and it makes people scared enough to halt their activism.” </p>

像这样的案件是精心挑选并作为示例的，圣彼得堡市议员谢尔盖·特罗申（Sergey Troshin）公开支持斯米尔诺娃女士和斯科奇连科女士，他这样说道：“国家为自己设定的任务就是找几个人，在公众面前给他们判重刑。”“你可以将这种做法看作是‘精确镇压’，它足以让人们感到害怕，从而停止他们的行动主义。”


<p>According to <small>OVD</small>-Info, a human-rights monitor, approximately 160 Russians have been imprisoned and over 850 have been prosecuted for anti-war activities since the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. </p>

根据人权监督组织OVD-Info的数据，自2022年2月俄乌全面入侵以来，大约有160名俄罗斯人因反战活动而被监禁，超过850人遭到起诉。


<p>The prison system has also been used as a reward for loyalty as much as a punishment for defiance. Prisoners, many of whom had been convicted for multiple, violent crimes, have walked free with full pardons after serving in the Russian army in Ukraine for as little as six months. This has been framed in state-run media outlets and friendly social media as a reward for loyalty to a new national project centred on resistance to the West, the promotion of a multipolar world and Russia’s continuing influence in the “near abroad”. </p>

监狱体系也被作为一种奖励，用于表彰对新国家项目——以抵抗西方、推动多极世界以及保持俄罗斯在“周边”地区的影响力为中心——的忠诚。在国家媒体和友好的社交媒体上，服完六个月乌克兰战场役的囚犯们被宣称为全面特赦的受益者，从而自由地走出监狱。


<div><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p>However, a recent investigation conducted by <small>BBC </small>Russia uncovered a shift in policy. In an effort to curb local resentment, and probably to distance the president from what has proved to be a controversial policy during the runup to the presidential elections next month, ex-convict veterans are now required to serve until the war’s end in return for probation rather than a pardon. Exoneration may only be received in cases when soldiers reach the military’s age limit, earn a special commendation or are maimed in combat, described as “health loss”. <span>■</span></p>

然而，英国广播公司俄罗斯频道最近进行的一项调查揭示了政策方向的变化。政府试图通过这一举措来缓和地方的不满情绪，同时可能也想要让总统与那些在即将到来的总统选举前被证明具有争议性的政策保持一定距离。

为了换取缓刑而不是特赦，要求曾经服过刑的老兵们必须一直服役直到战争结束为止，这种情况被称为“健康损失”下的赦免。■
